  "contentText": "CHAPTER I.\n\nA DOUBLE MURDER.\n\n“Hello! hello! This is Frank Mantell talking. I want Mr. Carter—Nick Carter. Is he there?”\n\nPatsy Garvan, the detective’e’s junior assistant, then alone in the library of Nick’k’s Madison Avenue residence, was the\nrecipient of the above telephone communication. It came over the wire in tones reflecting the haste and excitement of the speaker.\n\nPatsy remembered him, a son of the senior partner of the firm of Mantell & Goulard, whose big department store in Sixth Avenue had\nrecently been wrecked by a long series of mysterious robberies committed by the junior partner, Gaston Goulard, resulting in a\nround-up of the criminal and his confederates by Nick and his assistants, all of which had transpired several months before.\n\n“No,” Patsy replied. “Nick Carter is not here. He is out on a case.”\n\n“Is Chick Carter there?” Mantell then hurriedly asked, referring to the detective’e’s chief assistant.\n\n“He is not, Mr. Mantell. This is Garvan talking.”\n\n“Ah, yes, Patsy—I remember,” was the reply. “When will Nick return?”\n\n“I don’n’t know. He went with Chick about an hour ago to investigate a big murder case in Manhattanville. He may not return until\nevening.”\n\n“Dear me, I’I’m sorry to hear that. I am very anxious to see him.”\n\n“On business?”\n\n“Yes. Very important business. There is half a million dollars involved.”\n\n“Great Scott! Can I be of any help to you?”\n\n“Not unless you can enable me to see Nick himself. Time is very valuable.”\n\n \n\n“I can do that, perhaps,” said Patsy. “I can learn from police headquarters just where he has gone. You can go there and see him,\nor—where are you phoning from, Mr. Mantell?”\n\n“From the office of Gray’y’s wharf, East River. I cannot explain by telephone. If——”\n\n“One moment,” Patsy interrupted. “Have you a taxi?”\n\n“I have my touring car.”\n\n“Good enough! Join me here as quickly as possible. I’I’ll find out in the meantime where Nick is engaged. We’e’ll go there and see\nhim.”\n\n“Thanks, Garvan, a thousand times. I’I’ll be with you in ten minutes.”\n\nIt then was about ten o’o’clock in the morning. One hour earlier, complying with an urgent telephone request from the police\nheadquarters, Nick Carter and Chick arrived in the detective’e’s touring car at a dwelling in one of the outskirts of\nManhattanville, the scene of a shocking crime evidently committed the previous night.\n\nIt was an attractive wooden house somewhat back from the street and occupying a corner lot.\n\nIt was in a quiet and entirely reputable locality, though somewhat thinly settled, and it was about the last neighborhood in which\nsuch a crime would have been expected.\n\nMore than a score of people had collected on the opposite side of the street, and were viewing the house with feelings of morbid\ncuriosity. They were prevented from coming nearer, however, or encroaching upon the surrounding grounds, by policemen who had been\nstationed on both the front and side gates.\n\nA police sergeant who was standing with an elderly man on the front veranda recognized the two detectives when the touring car\nstopped at the house, and he beckoned for them to enter that way.\n\n“We have been waiting for you, Mr. Carter,” he said respectfully, when Nick came up the gravel walk with Chick. “This is Doctor\nBoyden, who lives in the third house from here. I sent for him a few minutes ago, thinking you might want his opinion as to the\nlength of time the two men have been dead, as well as any other information he can give you.”\n\n“There certainly is a deep mystery here, aside from the shocking crime, Mr. Carter, judging from the appearance of things in the\nhouse,” said the physician, after shaking hands with both detectives. “It looks like a veritable slaughter pen. There must have\nbeen an awful fight here.”\n\n“Come in, Mr. Carter, and see for yourself,” added the sergeant.\n\n“One moment, Kennedy,” said Nick, detaining him. “Who lives in the house? I see that the name plate has been removed from the\ndoor.”\n\n“I can answer that question for you better than Sergeant Kennedy, perhaps,” put in Doctor Boyden.\n\n“If you please, then.”\n\n“The house is owned by Mr. George Roland, who occupied it with his wife until about a month ago. She died quite suddenly at that\ntime, and Roland since has been living with a married sister in Harlem.”\n\n“Leaving this house vacant?”\n\n“Yes. He owns it and the furnishings, however, and it has been in the market to rent. I noticed yesterday that the broker’r’s\nplacard had been removed from the front window, and I inferred that the house had been rented.”\n\n“Are you acquainted with Roland?” Nick inquired.\n\n“Yes, indeed, very well acquainted.”\n\n“Is he a man of good character?”\n\n“Excellent. I consider him incapable of crime.”\n\n“Do you know anything about the new tenants, or whether this furnished house has really been rented?”\n\n“I think it has, sir,” said Sergeant Kennedy. “I used the telephone in the next house, Mr. Carter, and talked with the broker, Mr.\nGibson.”\n\n“What did you learn?”\n\n“He stated that he showed the house day before yesterday to a couple who claimed to be Mr. and Mrs. Charles Greenleaf, of\nBrooklyn. They did not then decide to rent the house, but they called at his office again yesterday afternoon and requested the\nprivilege of taking the key until this morning, stating that they wanted to show the dwelling to a relative who lives with them,\nand whose business would prevent him from visiting the house except in the evening. Gibson was favorably impressed with the\ncouple. He let the man have the key, with an understanding that it would be returned to-day, and——”\n\n“And the rascals got in their work,” Nick interrupted, with some dryness. “This looks very much as if the furnished house was\ncraftily obtained only in order to pull off a knavish job of some kind.”\n\n“Surely,” said Chick, with a nod. “That’t’s just about the size of it.”\n\n“The job was pulled off, all right,” replied the sergeant. “Come in, Mr. Carter, and see for yourself.”\n\n“Presently.” Nick still detained him. “I first want to learn what is known about the crime. Who discovered it?”\n\n“A milkman who called at the house in the rear of this one about an hour ago,” said Kennedy. “He saw an old slouch hat in the back\nyard, near the fence that divides the two lots. He went and picked it up and found fresh spots of blood on it.”\n\n“And then?”\n\n“Looking over the rear fence, he then saw that the back door of this house was wide open,” Kennedy continued. “He could see no\none, however, and knew that the house had not been occupied for a month. He then suspected there was something wrong, and he\ndecided to look into the matter.”\n\n“What did he do?” questioned Nick.\n\n“He vaulted the fence and entered the back door. That is as far as he went. It’t’s as far as most men would have gone. When he saw\nthe corpse on the kitchen floor—well, he dropped the hat and bolted.”\n\n“Bolted where?”\n\n“Luckily, Mr. Carter, he ran nearly into the arms of Policeman Brady, who is on this beat in the morning,” said Kennedy. “He told\nhim what he had seen, and Brady returned with him to the house. He saw at a glance that a double murder had been committed, and he\nthen notified the precinct station.”\n\n“That was about an hour ago.”\n\n“Yes. I was sent here with other officers, but was told to let things alone until you arrived, as headquarters had requested you\nto take on the case. That’t’s all there is to it.”\n\n“You mean, Kennedy, that that’t’s the beginning of it,” said Nick. “To learn what there really is to it may tax the discernment of\nthe best of us.”\n\n“That’t’s true, Mr. Carter, after all,” Kennedy readily allowed.\n\n“Have you inquired at the neighboring houses?”\n\n“Yes, sir. Only a woman living opposite can supply any information.”\n\n“What is that?”\n\n“She saw two men and a woman, presumably Gibson and the couple mentioned, entering the house day before yesterday,” Kennedy\nproceeded to report. “Something like an hour after dark yesterday, or about seven o’o’clock in the evening, the same woman was\nseated at her front window waiting for her husband to come home to supper. She saw two men entering this house, and a moment later\nshe saw the reflection of a light in the dining room.”\n\n“In any other rooms?”\n\n“No, sir. Nor could she tell me anything more, for her husband came in just then and she went to supper with him.”\n\nNick glanced toward the street.\n\n“There is an arc light on the corner,” he observed. “I suppose, since it was evening, that the electric light enabled her to see\nthe two men.”\n\n“Yes, sir. I asked her about that.”\n\n“Did you ask her for a description of them?”\n\n“I did, sir,” Kennedy nodded. “She said that one appeared to be a man of middle age and was very well dressed. She also noticed\nthat he wore a full beard.”\n\n“Possibly a disguise.”\n\n“The other looked a bit rough, she said, and wore a gray slouch hat, the same that the milkman found in the next yard this\nmorning,” said Kennedy. “I sent an officer over to show it to her, and she readily identified it.”\n\n“Anything more?” queried Nick.\n\n“She told me he carried a suit case, also, and she judged that he had come from a distance. She noticed that the suit case\nappeared to be old and battered and that one of the straps was dangling, corresponding with the general appearance of the man\nhimself. That was all she could tell me.”\n\n“Was any disturbance heard last evening by people in the neighboring houses?” Nick asked.\n\n“No, sir,” said Kennedy. “I have inquired at every house.”\n\n“Did the woman living opposite see from which direction the two men came?”\n\n“She did. They came around the corner and entered the front door of this house.”\n\n“I see that you have unlocked it,” Nick remarked, observing that the door then was ajar. “Have you identified either of the two\nvictims?”\n\n“No, sir. I have not tried, Mr. Carter, as a matter of fact, knowing that you were on your way here. By their looks——”\n\n“I will size up their looks for myself, Kennedy,” Nick interposed. “Are things about as you found them?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Did Brady disturb anything?”\n\n“No, sir. He has been on the force long enough to know where he is at.”\n\n“Very good.” Nick turned and opened the door. “I’I’ll have a look at the scene. Come with me, Chick.”\n\nChick Carter accompanied him into the house, followed a moment later by Sergeant Kennedy and the physician.\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nA PERPLEXING PROBLEM.\n\nNick Carter had only to enter the hall of the house to see the first signs of the sanguinary conflict of the previous night.\n\nOn the wall opposite the dining-room door were spots and streaks of blood, great, irregular streaks and smooches, as if drops and\nsplotches that had spurted upon the wall paper had been rubbed and spread by the garments of persons engaged in a terrific\nstruggle. A rug near by had been kicked into a shapeless heap near the baseboard.\n\nNick merely glanced at these, then paused at the open door of the dining room, in which the scene was doubly shocking.\n\nThe roller shades of both windows had been raised, admitting the morning sunlight.\n\nOne lamp of an electric chandelier still was burning. It looked wan and yellow in contrast with the bright light from outside.\n\n“Great guns!” Chick Carter muttered, then at Nick’k’s elbow. “What a scene of disorder.”\n\n“It’t’s the limit,” Nick tersely agreed.\n\n“Slaughter pen is right,” added Chick, recalling the remark of the physician.\n\nThe scene was, indeed, a shocking one. The table was out of place. Broken glasses from the sideboard strewed the floor. Chairs\nwere overturned and broken. Spots and splashes of blood were everywhere. It stood in a great, partly dry and congealed pool on the\nfloor between the table and the hall door—a pool in which the corpse of a murdered man was lying.\n\nHe had fallen upon his back and was lying with face upturned in the sunlight shed through one of the windows. There was a great\nbruise under one eye and a gash in his cheek.\n\nHe had been stabbed twice in the breast, and from the second wound still protruded the weapon used by his assailant, a knife\ndriven home to the victim’m’s heart with all the merciless energy of bitter vengefulness, or utter desperation.\n\nHe was a man in middle life and of powerful build, a smooth-shaven man of dark complexion, close-cut hair, and a hard, somewhat\nsinister cast of features.\n\n“Do you know him?” asked Nick, after viewing the scene for several moments.\n\n“No,” said Chick. “Do you?”\n\nNick stepped into the room and bent above the corpse. With the tip of his finger he lifted the dead man’n’s upper lip, revealing a\nquantity of gold bridgework on three of the teeth. He turned the left hand, also, and found that part of the third finger had been\namputated.\n\n“I thought I recognized him,” he remarked, rising and glancing again at the battered face. “We have his photograph in our album.”\n\n“Who is he?” Chick questioned.\n\n“Cornelius Taggart,” said Nick. “Better known to the police as Connie Taggart.”\n\n“By Jove, you’u’re right,” Chick declared, gazing. “I recognize him, now. Connie Taggart, the yegg and cracksman.”\n\n“He’e’s the man,” Nick nodded. “He has cracked his last crib and paid the price. He has been about as bad an egg, Chick, as one\noften finds in a basket. Have you examined this body, Doctor Boyden?”\n\nSergeant Kennedy and the physician had approached as far as the open door.\n\n“Only superficially,” was the physician’n’s reply.\n\n“How long would you say he has been dead?”\n\n“Fully twelve hours, Mr. Carter; probably longer.”\n\n“The crime must have been committed last evening, then.”\n\n“Undoubtedly.”\n\n“You raised these roller shades, Kennedy, I infer,” said Nick, glancing at the sergeant.\n\n“I did, sir.”\n\n“You found the electric lamp burning, of course.”\n\n“Yes, sir. I thought I had better leave it until you arrived. Aside from the two curtains, Mr. Carter, the room is as Brady found\nit when he entered.”\n\n“Very good.”\n\n“There is the hat found in the next yard by the milkman,” Kennedy added, pointing.\n\nNick took it from a chair on which it had been tossed and began to examine it.\n\nIt was of gray felt, much worn and defaced with grease and dirt. A twisted cord encircled it, with two small silk tassels, or the\nfrayed remnants of them. There were two round holes through the crown, on opposite sides of it.\n\nNick noted the size and examined the greasy interior. He found several short black hairs sticking to the sweat leather. The hat\nbore no trade-mark, however, nor any name or initial pointing to the identity of the owner.\n\nNevertheless, after a brief inspection, Nick said confidently:\n\n“The owner of this hat is a Mexican. It is like those worn by some of the Mexican troopers. He has done military service, too, as\nappears in these two holes through the crown. They are bullet holes.”\n\n“Could they have been made last night?” asked Chick.\n\n“No. The edge of the felt around them is much soiled, which would be comparatively clean if they were so recently made.”\n\n“I see.”\n\n“A bullet passed through the man’n’s hat in a battle, or some sort of a skirmish,” Nick added. “He is a man of middle size, I\njudge, with dark complexion and black hair.”\n\n“That answers the description the woman living opposite gave me,” put in Kennedy. “She saw him quite plainly when the two men came\naround the corner and entered the house.”\n\n“She stated that his companion wore a beard, I think you said.”\n\n“She did, Mr. Carter, and that he was well dressed.”\n\n“It could not have been this man, then, unless he was in disguise,” said Nick, glancing at Taggart’t’s beardless face. “The\ndisguise should be here, in that case, even though he removed it.”\n\n“I have not seen it,” said Kennedy.\n\n“Nor the suit case brought in by his companion?”\n\n“No, sir. That is not to be found. I have looked through the house.”\n\n“There must have been several men here, Nick, judging from the fight that came off,” Chick remarked.\n\n“Yes, undoubtedly,” Nick agreed. “I am seeking evidence that might explain the fight.”\n\n“It must have occurred quite soon after the two men entered.”\n\n“True.”\n\n“Others must have been here when they came in, then, or——”\n\n“One moment,” Nick interposed. “I’I’ll see what more I can find.”\n\nHe crouched again above Taggart’t’s body and searched his pockets. Aside from a fully loaded revolver, he found only a few\narticles of no special significance, nor any letter or writing whatever, that might otherwise have shed a ray of light on the\nmystery.\n\nNick then removed the weapon from the wound and examined it. It was a double-edged sheath knife with a blade about six inches\nlong, and with an elkhorn handle. It bore no mark of any kind, though it evidently had seen considerable service.\n\n“This undoubtedly belongs to the Mexican,” said Nick, placing it on the table after inspecting it. “Not one man in ten thousand in\nthese parts carries such a knife. They’y’re common in Mexico, however, which further confirms my theory as to the man’n’s\nnationality.”\n\n“I think you’u’re right,” said Chick. “It looks very much, too, as if he killed this crook in self-defense.”\n\n“That is my opinion, Chick, at present,” Nick replied, turning toward the hall. “We will look farther.”\n\n“This way to the kitchen,” said Kennedy. “The other body is there. You can go that way, if you prefer.”\n\nThe sergeant pointed to a closed door between the dining room and the kitchen, and Nick then turned in that direction.\n\n“Did you find this door closed, Kennedy, or open?” he inquired.\n\n“Closed, sir, just as you see it,” said Kennedy. “But I know it leads into the kitchen.”\n\n“I judged so.”\n\n“The fight evidently continued from here to the kitchen, but it was through the hall, not that way,” Kennedy added, as Nick opened\nthe door.\n\nThe scene in the kitchen was equally tragic, though the room was in less disorder than the other.\n\nA door leading into the rear yard was wide open.\n\nNearly on the threshold, so near that one foot touched it, though his head was toward the middle of the room, lay another victim\nof the fray of the previous night.\n\nHe then was lying on his back, though the body evidently had been turned over since the fatality, for the pool of blood in which\nit had lain was at one side.\n\nThe body was that of a man in the twenties, a well-built man in a dark plaid suit. A woolen cap had fallen from his head. His\nright arm was extended, the hand still holding with rigid death grip a loaded revolver.\n\nHe had been shot through the heart.\n\nBoth detectives immediately recognized this man, and Chick said quickly:\n\n“By Jove, it’t’s Batty Lang, Nick, the gangster. He finally has got what was coming to him.”\n\nNick bowed without speaking, with his gaze still fixed intently upon the man on the floor. He was noting his position, the\ndirection in which he had fallen, the weapon in his extended hand, and the outlook through the open back door.\n\nDoctor Boyden broke the brief silence.\n\n“You appear to know this man, also, Mr. Carter,” he said gravely.\n\n“Yes, I know him,” Nick now replied. “His name is Bartholomew Lang. He is an East Side product, and at times has been identified\nwith the notorious Ben Badger gang. He is more commonly called Batty Lang.”\n\n“Good heavens!” Doctor Boyden exclaimed. “It appears, then, that the house was filled with crooks and desperadoes last evening.”\n\n“And all here to nail that Mexican, Mr. Carter, if your theory as to his nationality is correct,” added Kennedy. “He must have put\nup an awful fight, if he got the best of them single-handed.”\n\n“I thoroughly agree with you, Kennedy—if that is what he did,” Nick said, a bit dryly.\n\n“Well, he evidently stabbed Taggart and shot this fellow, Batty Lang, as you call him,” Kennedy confidently vouchsafed. “He must\nhave got away with the suit case, too, though he lost his hat in his flight. How else can you size it up?”\n\nNick Carter did not inform him. Instead, without replying, he began a closer inspection of Lang’g’s body, carefully searching his\nseveral pockets, in none of which he found anything that appeared to bear in any way upon what had transpired the previous night,\nor what had led up to it.\n\nNick noted the probable direction from which the fatal bullet had been fired, however, and also that every chamber of the revolver\nin the gangster’r’s rigid hand still contained a cartridge.\n\n“Wait here, Kennedy, both you and Doctor Boyden,” he said, rising after making these investigations. “I shall return in a few\nminutes. Come with me, Chick.”\n\nNick led the way from the back door with the last, Chick following him. He then began an inspection of the ground in the rear\nyard, tracing numerous footprints to the back fence, over which he vaulted.\n\nThere the trail appeared to divide, tracks in the greensward showing that one or more persons had fled to the left and through the\ngrounds of an adjoining estate, while others had gone directly through the yard in the direction of the side street. The distance\nbetween the tracks, which were too faint to be of additional value, showed that all of these persons were running.\n\n“Follow those leading to the side street, Chick, and see what more you can learn,” Nick directed, after calling Chick’k’s\nattention to them. “I’I’ll trace the others and rejoin you out there in a few minutes.”\n\nNick traced his part of the trail through the adjoining grounds, as far as a gravel walk leading to the street on which the\nresidence fronted. There he lost it, though the fleeing men evidently had hurried to the street, where no further traces of them\ncould be found.\n\nNick then walked around the corner and rejoined Chick in the side street.\n\n“Nothing doing, Nick, except these tracks of an automobile which evidently stood here for some little time last evening,” said\nChick, pointing to the ground near the curbing. “These drippings of oil show that it remained here for some time. It would have\nbeen out of view by the woman living opposite the vacant dwelling, and it may be that the Mexican and his companion came here in\nit.”\n\n“Very possible,” said Nick. “The tire marks indicate that it was a touring car. It’t’s about ten to one that the gang which fled\nthis way departed in it.”\n\n“You speak as if you thought that there was more than one gang,” said Chick, with a look of surprise.\n\n“That is precisely what I think.”\n\n“For what reason?”\n\n“Several,” said Nick. “Circumstances indicate, to begin with, that the house was obtained from the broker, Gibson, only in order\nto turn a knavish trick on some one. Naturally, if that is true, we must infer that the Mexican was to be the victim of the job.”\n\n“Surely, since he was brought there and evidently had come from a distance, possibly all the way from Mexico,” said Chick.\n\n“The evidence in the house shows plainly, however, that four or five men were there, possibly more,” Nick continued. “A less\nnumber could not have put up such a fight, nor have caused so much destruction, in the brief time in which it must have occurred.”\n\n“I agree with you.”\n\n“It is obvious, too, that the Mexican could not have licked half a dozen men single-handed, surely not such desperate men as\nConnie Taggart and Batty Lang.”\n\n“Certainly not,” replied Chick decidedly. “They would have downed him right off the reel.”\n\n“He must have had help, then,” Nick reasoned. “That is why I think there were two factions in the fight. I mean, of course, two\ndifferent gangs.”\n\n“Both out to get the Mexican?” questioned Chick.\n\n“I’I’m not sure about that, though it now appears so,” Nick replied. “What they were going to gain by getting him is also an open\nquestion.”\n\n“Decidedly.”\n\n“Be that as it may, Chick, he evidently stabbed Taggart and undertook to escape in great haste. Otherwise he would not have left\nhis knife in the yegg’g’s breast.”\n\n“Surely not.”\n\n“The stabbing may have precipitated the fight, or have occurred after the fight began,” Nick proceeded. “There is no way by which\nthat can be immediately determined. It continued through the hall and into the kitchen, where Batty Lang was shot. Here, now, is\nan important point. It further indicates that there were two gangs in the house.”\n\n“What point is that?” Chick inquired.\n\n“You saw where Lang was lying, with his feet near the open door and his head toward the middle of the room. He pitched forward on\nhis face when shot, as the blood on the floor plainly shows.”\n\n“True. That was very evident.”\n\n“The bullet entered his breast, and came from the direction of the hall door,” Nick went on. “Obviously, then, he was facing the\nhall, with his back to the rear door of the house. That position, together with the fact that he had a revolver in his hand,\nconvinces me that he was attempting to prevent others, presumably including the person who shot him, from following others who had\nfled through the back door, probably including the Mexican.”\n\n“By Jove, that does appear logical,” said Chick. “That may explain how the Mexican got away with his suit case.”\n\n“I think I am right, Chick, despite that the case opens up a wide held for conjectures,” Nick replied. “I did not inform Kennedy\nand the physician, however, for we may find it of advantage to keep his theory to ourselves.”\n\n“Quite likely,” Chick agreed.\n\n“The matter must be sifted to the bottom.”\n\n“I’I’m with you.”\n\n“We will return to the house, now, and wait until Gibson arrives,” said Nick. “He can supply us with a clew, perhaps, to the\npersons who pretended they wanted to rent the house. He can give us a description of them, at least.”\n\n“Most likely,” said Chick, as they moved on. “It may be, Nick, that Taggart and Lang were confederates in a job to get the\nMexican, or——”\n\n“I don’n’t think they were confederates,” Nick interposed.\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“Because I feel sure that Taggart was killed by the Mexican, and his escape and the evidence that Lang was preventing others from\npursuing him, indicate that Lang was not a confederate of Taggart, but was opposed to him. No other deduction would be consistent\nwith all of the circumstances.”\n\n“That’t’s right, too,” Chick quickly nodded. “I see the point.”\n\n“Lang has been identified at times with the Ben Badger gang,” Nick added. “Badger is a tough ticket, also that notorious sister of\nhis, Sadie Badger. They’y’re the kingpins of about as bad a bunch as can be found in the East Side.”\n\n“Right again, Nick.”\n\n“I never have heard, however, that Connie Taggart was friendly with them. If any of them were with Lang last night, we may be able\nto find positive evidence of it and to force a squeal from them. Otherwise—hello!”\n\nNick broke off abruptly when they turned the corner, and Chick also saw the occasion for it.\n\n“Goodness!” he exclaimed. “There is Patsy, and—yes, by Jove, it’t’s Frank Mantell. What the deuce has sent them here?”\n\nThe touring car containing Patsy Garvan and Mantell, driven by the latter’r’s chauffeur, had just swerved to the sidewalk near the\nhouse in which the two murders had been committed.\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nTHE MAN FROM MEXICO.\n\nNick Carter hastened to join Patsy and Frank Mantell, pausing at the latter’r’s touring car to learn the occasion for his visit.\nHe had not long to wait, for Mantell hardly took time to greet him.\n\n“You must throw up this murder case, Nick; you really must, and take on a matter in which I am desperately interested,” he\nforcibly insisted. “More than half a million dollars are at stake. They’y’re hopelessly lost, in fact, unless you can trace and\nrecover them. You must drop this case and——”\n\n“Wait!” Nick interposed, after intently regarding him. “Keep your head. Who has lost so much money, and when?”\n\n“It’t’s not money,” Mantell replied, in hurried undertones. “It’t’s a collection of old jewels of vast value, which was obtained\nunder most extraordinary circumstances. I cannot inform you in detail out here, Nick, where I might be overheard by others. Come\nwith me to my residence, where——”\n\n“Presently, perhaps,” Nick again interrupted. “Come into this house, instead, where we can occupy one of the chambers. I then will\nhear what you have to say.”\n\nMantell did not wait for the invitation to be repeated. He sprang out of the car before it was fairly uttered, then accompanied\nthe detective to the house, followed by Chick and Patsy.\n\nNick lingered only to inform Sergeant Kennedy that he had other business for a few minutes, directing him to take charge of the\nhouse while he was engaged, and he then led his three companions to a front chamber and closed the door.\n\n“Now, Mantell, out with it as briefly as possible,” said he, when they were seated. “What is this matter in which you are so\ndesperately interested?”\n\nHe had read in Mantell’l’s pale face the depths of his anxiety and distress, and knowing him to have a level head and excellent\njudgment and discretion, he reasoned that it must be a matter of extraordinary importance.\n\nMantell hastened to obey him.\n\n“It began, Nick, with a letter I received about ten days ago from an old college chum of mine, Calvin Vandyke, a man able in every\nway to judge of what he wrote me,” he said earnestly. “Unfortunately, however, I haven’n’t the letter in my pocket. It is in the\ndesk in my library.”\n\n“Well, well, what is it about?” Nick inquired. “Where is Mr. Vandyke?”\n\n“He now is in Mexico City, under so important a contract that he cannot possibly leave the country for several months.”\n\n“Mexico City, eh?”\n\nNick shot a swift, furtive glance at Chick, so significant that the latter suppressed a look of surprise and remained silent.\n\n“Yes,” Mantell quickly nodded. “The letter he wrote me explained all that, Nick, and why he made me his partner in this matter,\ngiving me an equal interest with him and the third party involved.”\n\n“Who is the third party?”\n\n“A Mexican named Juan Padillo, recently a soldier in Villa’a’s forces during the campaign in northern Mexico. He has deserted, and\nnow is in this city. That is to say—if he still is in the land of the living. I’I’m far from sure of it.”\n\n“Explain,” said Nick. “Why did Juan Padillo become a deserter?”\n\n“Because of a find he made during the sacking of an old monastery in Chihuahua territory, after the subjection of that section in\nwhich it is located and the flight of most of the inhabitants. Vandyke has quietly looked up the legal side of the matter, and he\nfinds that the retention of these spoils of war is entirely legitimate. In other words, Juan Padillo has a right to retain his\nprize and dispose of it to the best advantage.”\n\n“Admitting that, Mantell, what are the other circumstances?” Nick inquired.\n\n“They may be briefly stated. Padillo made this find in a secret vault, which he discovered entirely by chance, under a wine cellar\nin the monastery. He was the only person in Mexico who knew of his discovery and that he got away with his plunder, with the\nsingle exception of Calvin Vandyke, with whom Padillo long has had friendly relations, and to whom he turned for aid and advice.”\n\n“Of what do these spoils of war, as you call them, consist?” Nick questioned.\n\n“I can give you only an idea, Nick, without referring to Vandyke’e’s letter, which describes the articles in detail and estimates\ntheir value,” said Mantell. “They consist of clerical robes and jewels of great antiquity, which, Vandyke has learned, must have\nbeen brought from Spain as far back as the sixteenth century, and which probably have since been kept in concealment in the\nmonastery vault.”\n\n“Give me an idea of them.”\n\n“Well, one article is an archbishop’p’s robe of purple, wrought with a design in diamonds, emeralds, rubies, and pearls. The gems\nare mounted in gold, covering the entire breast of the robe, with a design consisting of the ancient Spanish coat of arms, the\ndouble eagles back to back, with wings raised and beaks open.”\n\n“I recall it,” Nick nodded.\n\n“There are two gold crowns, also, lavishly mounted with diamonds, emeralds, and sapphires, the most of which are of unusual size\nand corresponding value. In addition to these are other clerical robes of purple and white silk, all worked with gems the worth of\nwhich could only be roughly estimated. Vandyke places the value of the entire prize, however, at about six hundred thousand\ndollars.”\n\n“Gee whiz!” Patsy quietly exclaimed. “That sure was some find.”\n\n“Juan Padillo was much dazzled by it, of course, and scarce knew what to do,” Mantell earnestly continued. “He did not dare to\nconfide in any of his countrymen. He determined to take advantage of the prize, however, and to get out of the country with it.”\n\n“How long ago was that?” Nick inquired.\n\n“Nearly two months. He obtained an old leather suit case, in which he packed the spoils, and with which he succeeded in reaching\nMexico City, where he at once sought Vandyke and confided in him, offering to share equally with him in return for his advice and\nassistance.”\n\n“I see.”\n\n“Vandyke looked into the matter, keeping Padillo concealed in his residence,” Mantell went on. “He then realized the vast value of\nthe prize, but being utterly unable to leave the country himself, he proposed including me in the matter on an equal footing,\ntelling Padillo that he could come to me and that I would dispose of the gems at their market value. Padillo eagerly accepted the\nproposal, knowing that he would be shot as a deserter, if caught, and that he must lose no time in getting out of the country.”\n\n“I follow you,” Nick put in.\n\n“Vandyke then smuggled him to Vera Cruz, and finally got him on board a schooner about to leave for New York, paying his passage\nand giving him careful instructions.”\n\n“Namely?”\n\n“He directed him not to leave the vessel after his arrival here until I called for him, also not to open the suit case until he\nwas safe in my residence, and to pretend all the while that he was a penniless Mexican on his way to join relatives in this city.”\n\n“All were wise precautions,” Nick remarked.\n\n“Vandyke then sent me a letter, stating all of these facts and invited me to coöperate with him,” Mantell continued. “Naturally,\nwith two hundred thousand dollars in view, I was more than glad to comply. I wrote Vandyke to that effect, and since have been\nconstantly on the watch for the arrival of the vessel. She was docked at Gray’y’s wharf late yesterday afternoon. But I did not\nlearn of it until I read the shipping news this morning. I then rushed down to the wharf with my touring car, only to learn\nthat——”\n\n“That Juan Padillo left the vessel soon after her arrival yesterday and in company with a man who used your name,” said Nick,\ninterrupting.\n\n“Good heavens!” Mantell exclaimed, with a gasp. “How did you know that?”\n\n“Your anxiety, coupled with the fact that Padillo was to remain on the vessel until you called for him, admits of no other\ndeductions,” Nick replied evasively.\n\n“You are right, Carter, perfectly right,” Mantell said, with a groan. “Padillo left the vessel about six o’o’clock last evening,\ntaking with him the suit case containing his plunder.”\n\n“With a man who used your name?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Who informed you?”\n\n“The captain of the vessel.”\n\n“What more could he tell you?”\n\n“Only that Padillo had, as I then could judge, carefully followed the directions Vandyke had given him. Captain Macy evidently\nknew nothing about the contents of the suit case, and he said it was the only piece of luggage the Mexican had, and that he had\ntaken it ashore. He could give me only a vague description of the man who called for him, and said that Padillo appeared relieved\nand eager to accompany him. They left from the head of the wharf in a touring car, and——”\n\n“And that’t’s all you know about them,” Nick again interrupted.\n\n“I admit that, Carter, and that’t’s why I want your aid,” Mantell said earnestly. “This man and the suit case must be found. I\nnever can look Vandyke in the face. Think of it! If——”\n\n“That’t’s what I am doing,” said Nick, smiling a bit oddly. “Now, Mantell, answer my questions. I then may do something more than\nthink. Whom have you told about this matter?”\n\n“Only three persons,” Mantell quickly asserted. “My wife and my parents, with whom Helen and I have been living since our\nmarriage. You knew, of course, that I was married eight weeks ago to Helen Bailey, the pretty telephone girl whom you served so\nkindly—and who, I may add, thinks so well of you Carters.”\n\n“Yes, indeed, I know all about that, Mantell, but it’t’s irrelevant just now,” smiled Nick. “Did you caution your parents,\nhowever, to say nothing about the matter?”\n\n“I did so most impressively.”\n\n“Do you think they have obeyed you?”\n\n“Yes, positively.”\n\n“Where did you talk with them about it?”\n\n“At home, Nick, in the library.”\n\n“You must have been overheard.”\n\n“I don’n’t think so.”\n\n“I know so,” Nick insisted. “Either that, Mantell, or the letter sent you by Vandyke has been read by one of your servants, or by\nsome outsider. In no other way, if your wife and parents have been silent on the subject, could the man who lured Juan Padillo\nfrom the vessel and used your name have learned anything about the matter.”\n\n“I confess that I am mystified, Carter, as well as filled with dismay,” Mantell hopelessly admitted. “You are the only one to whom\nI can turn. What can be done? How can——”\n\n“Stop a moment,” Nick interposed, rising abruptly. “There is nothing in further discussing the case. Return to your car, Mantell,\nand wait until I rejoin you. Go with him, Patsy.”\n\n“Which may mean that you will——”\n\n“Look into the matter?” Nick cut in again. “Yes, I will do what I can for you. Time is of value, moreover, so don’n’t delay to\nthank me. Go at once.”\n\nPatsy led the way, Mantell following, with an expression of great relief on his refined, attractive face.\n\n“Well, by Jove, that sheds limelight on this murder mystery,” said Chick, lingering briefly with Nick in the chamber. “This\ncertainly is a remarkable coincidence.”\n\n“I suspected something of the kind, Chick, when he mentioned the loss of a vast quantity of jewels,” Nick replied. “That was one\nreason why I consented to hear his story.”\n\n“You have no doubt, of course, that the Mexican who was here last evening was Juan Padillo.”\n\n“Not the slightest.”\n\n“Lured here by crooks who had learned of the circumstances and been watching for the vessel.”\n\n“Exactly. They were more alert than Mantell, and got in their work ahead of him.”\n\n“But how do you size up what occurred here?”\n\n“I’I’m not quite ready to say,” said Nick. “I am going with Mantell to his residence. You remain here and get what information\nGibson can impart. Have a look in the meantime at the doors and windows of the house. There may be evidence indicating that it was\nbroken into by some of the rascals afterward engaged in the fight.”\n\n“I’I’ll find it, Nick, if there is any,” Chick confidently predicted. “I see at what you are driving.”\n\n“Have Kennedy summon the coroner, also, and direct him to take the customary legal steps here,” Nick added. “Say nothing about\nwhat we have learned and suspect, but tell him we will continue our investigations, and report later.”\n\n“I’I’ve got you.”\n\n“Having taken those steps, rejoin me at Mantell’l’s residence as quickly as possible,” Nick directed. “He lives——”\n\n“I know the house. It’t’s the mansion built by Mantell, the senior, in Riverside Drive,” Chick put in. “I will lose no time in\nfollowing you.”\n\n“I will go with Mantell in his car, leaving Danny to bring you in ours,” said Nick, as both turned from the chamber. “There must\nbe quick work done on this case, or, unless I am much mistaken, both Juan Padillo and his war prize of ancient jewels will go by\nthe board.”\n\n“Quick work, then, is the proper caper,” Chick declared. “I’I’ll see you a little later.”\n\nNick did not reply, but hastened out to the car in which Patsy and Frank Mantell were waiting.\n\n“To your residence,” he directed, addressing the latter. “Let her go at top speed, chauffeur. Minutes count.”\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nA STARTLING DISCOVERY.\n\nIt was nearly noon when the touring car containing Nick Carter and his companions sped up the broad driveway and stopped under the\nporte-cochère of the magnificent Mantell mansion overlooking the Hudson.\n\n“We shall not find my father at home, Nick,” Mantell remarked, while alighting from the car. “He still is engaged in settling up\nthe affairs of our defunct department store, wrecked by the knavery of his junior partner, that treacherous miscreant, Gaston\nGoulard. No need to tell you of that rascal, Nick, whom you so quickly pulled up to the ringbolt after taking on the case.”\n\n“No need, indeed,” Nick replied, a bit grimly. “It was deucedly unfortunate, though, that he slipped through the meshes of the\nlegal net and eluded the punishment he deserved.”\n\n“Decidedly so.”\n\n“His being a partner in the business was all that saved him,” Nick added. “It enabled a clever criminal lawyer to pull him out of\nthe fire, on grounds that either of the partners had a legal right to dispose at will of the property of the firm. It was a hard\nfight, and the rascal got away without punishment, barring the penalty he had brought upon himself, that of financial ruin and\nhopeless dishonor.”\n\n“Right in both respects,” Mantell nodded. “Gaston Goulard is down and out forever.”\n\n“By the way, Mantell, do you ever see him?” Nick inquired.\n\n“Yes, occasionally,” was the reply. “I never see him, however, that he does not threaten to get even with me for the past.”\n\n“Humph!” Nick ejaculated contemptuously.\n\n“Get even, indeed!” Mantell bitterly added. “The boot should be on the other leg. He hates me for having won and married Helen\nBailey, Nick, to whose hand he had aspirations even while engaged in his treacherous robberies. I saw him about ten days ago,\nlooking seedy enough, Nick, and as if dissipation was making inroads upon his health.”\n\n“Threatened you, Mantell, has he?” questioned Nick, with brows knitting slightly.\n\n“Repeatedly,” Mantell nodded, as they mounted the steps. “I somehow fear the rascal, Nick, for he is capable of any degree of\nknavery, and is a desperate dog when crossed. I expect trouble from him, in fact, and for that reason am constantly alert.”\n\n“I predicted after his exposure and arrest that he would go to the bad,” said Nick. “Ah, this is a pleasure, indeed, Mrs.\nMantell.”\n\nHaving entered the handsomely furnished house while speaking, where they were met in the hall by Mantell’l’s charming young wife,\nthe beautiful girl whom Nick first had seen at a telephone switchboard, under circumstances that revealed her lofty and heroic\ncharacter, as well as which enabled him to be of great service to her.\n\nShe hastened to shake hands with both him and Patsy, saying feelingly:\n\n“Your pleasure could not be greater than mine, Mr. Carter. I am delighted to see you. I ought to scold you roundly, however, for\nnot having called here occasionally, at least.”\n\n“That’t’s right, too, Helen,” put in Mantell.\n\n“You overlook one fact,” smiled Nick, replying to her.\n\n“What is that, Mr. Carter?”\n\n“That I have hardly an hour in the week, not to say in a day, that I can really call my own,” Nick said gravely. “I am a very busy\nman, you know.”\n\n“Ah, I suppose so,” Helen rejoined. “And chiefly because other men are so wicked.”\n\n“True.”\n\n“It is deplorable.”\n\n“True again,” said Nick. “Nor am I less busy than usual this morning. I think, Frank, we had better get right at this matter.”\n\n“I think so, too.”\n\n“I’I’m sure your wife will excuse us.”\n\nShe bowed and smiled agreeably, and Nick and Patsy followed Mantell into the library, a superbly furnished room overlooking the\nside grounds.\n\n“Now, Nick, what can I tell you?” he asked, placing chairs for them. “Why have you come here?”\n\n“To begin with, Mantell, I want to see the letter written to you by Calvin Vandyke,” said Nick. “Where have you kept it?”\n\n“Here, in my desk,” said Mantell, rising to unlock a large roll-top desk in one corner of the spacious room.\n\n“Is your desk usually locked?”\n\n“Always, Nick, when I am absent.”\n\n“Wait one moment,” said the detective. “Let me examine the lock.”\n\nMantell complied, handing him the key.\n\nNick unlocked the desk, and, rolling the top partly up, he began a careful inspection of the brass socket which received the bolt\nof the lock when the desk was securely closed. He found several tiny, faint scratches on one side of it, which could not have been\ncaused by the action of the bolt, not being where it came in contact with the socket. An examination with a powerful lens,\nmoreover, showed that these slight marks were quite bright, as if recently made and with an instrument as sharp as the point of a\npin.\n\nNick returned the ring of keys and resumed his seat.\n\n“That lock has recently been picked, Mantell,” he said confidently.\n\n“Picked!” Mantell exclaimed amazedly. “Are you sure of it?”\n\n“Positively.”\n\n“But——”\n\n“There aren’n’t any buts,” Nick interrupted. “I know when evidence shows that a lock has been picked. The crook who picked that\none used a tool with a sharp point, which at times touched one side of the bolt socket and left faint marks in the brass. The\nbrightness of them shows that it was quite recently done.”\n\n“But our servants are entirely trustworthy, Nick, and——”\n\n“I don’n’t think it was done by one of your servants,” Nick again interrupted. “Have you a burglar alarm in the house?”\n\n“Yes, an electric alarm,” said Mantell. “All of the doors and windows on the ground floor are protected. Perkins, the butler, sets\nit each night before he retires.”\n\n“This job may have been done during the day.”\n\n“But there is always some one in the house.”\n\n“I will look farther presently,” said Nick, not inclined to argue the point. “Let me see the Vandyke letter, also the envelope, if\nyou have it.”\n\nMantell took them from a pigeonhole in the desk and placed them in the detective’e’s hand.\n\nNick turned to the window and began to inspect them with his lens, which he had not replaced in his pocket. He did not read the\nletter, which covered several closely written sheets, and in which he apparently had no interest aside from the paper on which it\nwas written.\n\n“A man handling a tool small enough to pick the lock of a desk is very likely to soil the balls of his thumb and fingers with the\nmetal,” he remarked, after several moments. “There are faint marks and smooches both on this envelope and the backs of several\nsheets of the paper.”\n\n“I did not observe them,” said Mantell, noting the detective’e’s subtle intonation. “What do you make of them, Carter?”\n\n“They look very much like finger prints,” said Nick. “Patsy——”\n\n“Yes, chief.”\n\nPatsy had foreseen what was coming and was alert on the instant.\n\n“Mantell’l’s car is waiting outside,” said Nick, folding the letter and replacing it in the envelope. “His chauffeur will take you\nto our office and bring you back here. Examine these smooches with a magnifying glass and see what you make of them. If finger\nprints, compare them with our collection. Report as quickly as possible.”\n\n“Trust me for that, chief,” cried Patsy, hastening from the room.\n\n“While we are waiting, Mantell, I will have a look around the outside of the house,” said Nick, rising. “I may find evidence that\nit has been recently entered, in spite of your burglar alarm. You had better wait here. I can work more quickly alone.”\n\nNick walked out through the hall after the last remark, and ten minutes had passed, when he returned.\n\n“Well?” questioned Mantell anxiously. “What have you found?”\n\n“Nothing positively showing that the house was entered by night,” Nick replied, resuming his seat. “It may have been accomplished\nthrough a second-story window, however, several of which can be quite easily reached. I found, nevertheless, positive evidence of\nsomething else.”\n\n“Of what?”\n\n“That two men quite recently were playing the eavesdropper under your library windows,” said Nick. “There are partly obliterated\nfootprints in the greensward and the flower beds flanking the foundation wall below the windows.”\n\n“By Jove, is it possible!”\n\n“If they were under only one window, I would feel less confident,” Nick added. “The fact that traces of the same impressions\nappear under all of the windows convinces me that I am right. They were spying outside ten evenings ago.”\n\n“How do you fix the exact day?” Mantell questioned perplexedly.\n\n“By the character of the imprints and the condition of the near greensward, to which they frequently stepped,” Nick explained. “We\nhad a hard rain eleven days ago, and have had none since then.”\n\n“I remember.”\n\n“A hard rain would completely obliterate such imprints from the soil of a flower bed,” Nick went on. “These, then, must have been\nformed since the storm. The depth and irregular character of them, however, show that the soil must have been very soft and muddy,\nas if very soon after the rain. This appears, too, in that when they stepped to the greensward they left many traces of the soil\nclinging to their soles. I feel perfectly safe in saying that they were there the night after the storm.”\n\nMantell’l’s face had taken on a more serious expression.\n\n“By Jove, you have reminded me of something, Carter,” he said gravely.\n\n“What is that?”\n\n“It was on the day following that storm that I received Vandyke’e’s letter, and I read it aloud that evening to my wife and\nparents. We were here in the library. I begin to think your deductions are correct.”\n\n“I am very sure of it,” Nick declared, smiling a bit oddly.\n\n“But who could have been spying upon us, or playing the eavesdropper?”\n\n“There were two men, Mantell, judging from the different imprints, or what little is left of them,” said Nick. “They may have been\nhere with some other object in view, possibly the planning of a burglary. Their hearing that letter, however, may have been only\nincidental, though it evidently resulted in a change of their plans for an entirely different job.”\n\n“You mean that of getting and robbing Juan Padillo.”\n\n“Precisely.”\n\n“But why do you suspect that a burglary was contemplated?”\n\n“Because a notorious burglar, one of the most dangerous yeggs in the country, was killed last night in a house in Manhattanville,”\nNick now explained. “I refer to Cornelius Taggart, quite commonly known as Connie Taggart, the cracksman.”\n\n“Good heavens!” Mantell’l’s color had been steadily waning. “You imply, Carter, that he may have been one of the eavesdroppers,\nthat he may have been the scoundrel who used my name to deceive Juan Padillo.”\n\n“Either he, Mantell, or his confederate,” bowed Nick. “That is precisely what I think.”\n\n“But why? For any other reason?” Mantell asked anxiously.\n\n“Yes, a very potent reason,” nodded the detective. “Listen, Mantell, and I will tell why I think so.”\n\nNick then informed him of what had been discovered in the Manhattanville house, the evidence he had found, and many of the\nconclusions at which he had arrived.\n\nMantell listened without interrupting, but with steadily increasing apprehensions, as appeared in the look of despair that finally\nsettled on his drawn, white face.\n\n“There is nothing to it, Carter,” he said, with a groan, when Nick had concluded. “They have got both the man and the jewels. They\nhave killed Padillo, and the jewels are gone forever.”\n\n“Don’n’t be so sure of that,” said Nick. “I may find a way to save the man and recover the gems. That’t’s what I am seeking—the\nway.”\n\n“You mean——”\n\n“I mean that I want to discover, if possible, the identity of Taggart’t’s confederate,” Nick interrupted. “I then can shape up my\nwork. That is why I came here to see Vandyke’e’s letter. I suspect that a copy of it was made. I suspected, also, if it was\nobtained by breaking into the house and forcing your desk, that it might bear finger prints of the crooks. Patsy will report a\nlittle later.”\n\n“But why wouldn’n’t a crook have taken the letter itself?” questioned Mantell. “Why would he have made a copy of it?”\n\n“Because you would have missed the letter, and, of course, would have become suspicious,” Nick pointed out. “You would immediately\nhave taken steps to thwart the knavery that has been successfully accomplished through leaving the letter in its customary place.”\n\n“Yes, yes, I see,” Mantell nodded. “I ought to have thought of that. You suspect then, that——”\n\n“Wait! There comes my touring car with Chick and Danny, my chauffeur,” Nick interrupted, glancing from the window. “I must see\nwhat more he has learned.”\n\n“I will admit him,” cried Mantell, hastening to do so.\n\nChick entered the library with him a few moments later. He at once proceeded to report to Nick that Gibson, the house broker,\ncould add nothing definite to the statements he had made by telephone, and that his description of the couple who had called to\nrent the house were of but little value, the woman having been veiled at the time, while the man probably was in disguise.\n\nOn one of the basement windows, however, Chick had found convincing evidence that the house had been forcibly entered, but he\ncould discover no clew to the identity or number of the burglars.\n\n“Whether they were confederates of Taggart or——”\n\n“They were not,” said Nick, interrupting Chick’k’s report. “Taggart was killed by Padillo, and he either was the man who lured the\nMexican to the house, or a confederate of the man who did so. In either case, Chick, the Taggart gang would have had access to the\nhouse without breaking into it.”\n\n“That’t’s logical,” Chick quickly admitted. “There is no denying it.”\n\n“If we can discover the identity of Taggart’t’s confederate, therefore, we shall have a definite clew to both gangs that evidently\nwere in the house,” Nick added. “Ah, Patsy is returning. Admit him, Mantell. His haste indicates that he has made a discovery of\nsome importance.”\n\nNick had caught sight of the returning automobile, from which Patsy was hastening to alight before it came to a stop in the\ndriveway. He entered the library a moment later, and his first words confirmed Nick’k’s prediction.\n\n“They are finger prints, chief, all right,” he cried, returning the Vandyke letter.\n\n“Are there corresponding ones in our collection?” Nick inquired.\n\n“That’t’s what, chief.”\n\n“Whose are they, Patsy?”\n\n“Those of the crook who gave the law the slip, but not before we got his measurements and identification marks,” cried Patsy.\n“There is no mistaking them, chief. They are the finger prints of—Gaston Goulard!”",
  "contentHtml": "<h2>CHAPTER I.<br><br><small>A DOUBLE MURDER.</small></h2>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Hello! hello! This is Frank Mantell talking. I want Mr. Carter&mdash;Nick Carter. Is he there?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Patsy Garvan, the detective&rsquo;e&rsquo;s junior assistant, then alone in the library of Nick&rsquo;k&rsquo;s Madison Avenue residence, was the recipient of the above telephone communication. It came over the wire in tones reflecting the haste and excitement of the speaker.</p>\r\n<p>Patsy remembered him, a son of the senior partner of the firm of Mantell &amp; Goulard, whose big department store in Sixth Avenue had recently been wrecked by a long series of mysterious robberies committed by the junior partner, Gaston Goulard, resulting in a round-up of the criminal and his confederates by Nick and his assistants, all of which had transpired several months before.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Patsy replied. &ldquo;Nick Carter is not here. He is out on a case.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Is Chick Carter there?&rdquo; Mantell then hurriedly asked, referring to the detective&rsquo;e&rsquo;s chief assistant.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;He is not, Mr. Mantell. This is Garvan talking.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, Patsy&mdash;I remember,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;When will Nick return?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;n&rsquo;t know. He went with Chick about an hour ago to investigate a big murder case in Manhattanville. He may not return until evening.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Dear me, I&rsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that. I am very anxious to see him.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;On business?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes. Very important business. There is half a million dollars involved.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Great Scott! Can I be of any help to you?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Not unless you can enable me to see Nick himself. Time is very valuable.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I can do that, perhaps,&rdquo; said Patsy. &ldquo;I can learn from police headquarters just where he has gone. You can go there and see him, or&mdash;where are you phoning from, Mr. Mantell?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;From the office of Gray&rsquo;y&rsquo;s wharf, East River. I cannot explain by telephone. If&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; Patsy interrupted. &ldquo;Have you a taxi?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I have my touring car.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Good enough! Join me here as quickly as possible. I&rsquo;I&rsquo;ll find out in the meantime where Nick is engaged. We&rsquo;e&rsquo;ll go there and see him.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Garvan, a thousand times. I&rsquo;I&rsquo;ll be with you in ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>It then was about ten o&rsquo;o&rsquo;clock in the morning. One hour earlier, complying with an urgent telephone request from the police headquarters, Nick Carter and Chick arrived in the detective&rsquo;e&rsquo;s touring car at a dwelling in one of the outskirts of Manhattanville, the scene of a shocking crime evidently committed the previous night.</p>\r\n<p>It was an attractive wooden house somewhat back from the street and occupying a corner lot.</p>\r\n<p>It was in a quiet and entirely reputable locality, though somewhat thinly settled, and it was about the last neighborhood in which such a crime would have been expected.</p>\r\n<p>More than a score of people had collected on the opposite side of the street, and were viewing the house with feelings of morbid curiosity. They were prevented from coming nearer, however, or encroaching upon the surrounding grounds, by policemen who had been stationed on both the front and side gates.</p>\r\n<p>A police sergeant who was standing with an elderly man on the front veranda recognized the two detectives when the touring car stopped at the house, and he beckoned for them to enter that way.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We have been waiting for you, Mr. Carter,&rdquo; he said respectfully, when Nick came up the gravel walk with Chick. &ldquo;This is Doctor Boyden, who lives in the third house from here. I sent for him a few minutes ago,&nbsp;thinking you might want his opinion as to the length of time the two men have been dead, as well as any other information he can give you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;There certainly is a deep mystery here, aside from the shocking crime, Mr. Carter, judging from the appearance of things in the house,&rdquo; said the physician, after shaking hands with both detectives. &ldquo;It looks like a veritable slaughter pen. There must have been an awful fight here.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Come in, Mr. Carter, and see for yourself,&rdquo; added the sergeant.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;One moment, Kennedy,&rdquo; said Nick, detaining him. &ldquo;Who lives in the house? I see that the name plate has been removed from the door.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I can answer that question for you better than Sergeant Kennedy, perhaps,&rdquo; put in Doctor Boyden.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;If you please, then.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The house is owned by Mr. George Roland, who occupied it with his wife until about a month ago. She died quite suddenly at that time, and Roland since has been living with a married sister in Harlem.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Leaving this house vacant?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes. He owns it and the furnishings, however, and it has been in the market to rent. I noticed yesterday that the broker&rsquo;r&rsquo;s placard had been removed from the front window, and I inferred that the house had been rented.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Are you acquainted with Roland?&rdquo; Nick inquired.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, very well acquainted.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Is he a man of good character?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Excellent. I consider him incapable of crime.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Do you know anything about the new tenants, or whether this furnished house has really been rented?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I think it has, sir,&rdquo; said Sergeant Kennedy. &ldquo;I used the telephone in the next house, Mr. Carter, and talked with the broker, Mr. Gibson.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;What did you learn?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;He stated that he showed the house day before yesterday to a couple who claimed to be Mr. and Mrs. Charles Greenleaf, of Brooklyn. They did not then decide to rent the house, but they called at his office again yesterday afternoon and requested the privilege of taking the key until this morning, stating that they wanted to show the dwelling to a relative who lives with them, and whose business would prevent him from visiting the house except in the evening. Gibson was favorably impressed with the couple. He let the man have the key, with an understanding that it would be returned to-day, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;And the rascals got in their work,&rdquo; Nick interrupted, with some dryness. &ldquo;This looks very much as if the furnished house was craftily obtained only in order to pull off a knavish job of some kind.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said Chick, with a nod. &ldquo;That&rsquo;t&rsquo;s just about the size of it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The job was pulled off, all right,&rdquo; replied the sergeant. &ldquo;Come in, Mr. Carter, and see for yourself.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Presently.&rdquo; Nick still detained him. &ldquo;I first want to learn what is known about the crime. Who discovered it?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;A milkman who called at the house in the rear of this one about an hour ago,&rdquo; said Kennedy. &ldquo;He saw an old slouch hat in the back yard, near the fence that divides the two lots. He went and picked it up and found fresh spots of blood on it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Looking over the rear fence, he then saw that the&nbsp;back door of this house was wide open,&rdquo; Kennedy continued. &ldquo;He could see no one, however, and knew that the house had not been occupied for a month. He then suspected there was something wrong, and he decided to look into the matter.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;What did he do?&rdquo; questioned Nick.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;He vaulted the fence and entered the back door. That is as far as he went. It&rsquo;t&rsquo;s as far as most men would have gone. When he saw the corpse on the kitchen floor&mdash;well, he dropped the hat and bolted.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Bolted where?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Luckily, Mr. Carter, he ran nearly into the arms of Policeman Brady, who is on this beat in the morning,&rdquo; said Kennedy. &ldquo;He told him what he had seen, and Brady returned with him to the house. He saw at a glance that a double murder had been committed, and he then notified the precinct station.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;That was about an hour ago.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes. I was sent here with other officers, but was told to let things alone until you arrived, as headquarters had requested you to take on the case. That&rsquo;t&rsquo;s all there is to it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You mean, Kennedy, that that&rsquo;t&rsquo;s the beginning of it,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;To learn what there really is to it may tax the discernment of the best of us.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;t&rsquo;s true, Mr. Carter, after all,&rdquo; Kennedy readily allowed.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Have you inquired at the neighboring houses?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Only a woman living opposite can supply any information.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;She saw two men and a woman, presumably Gibson and the couple mentioned, entering the house day before yesterday,&rdquo; Kennedy proceeded to report. &ldquo;Something like an hour after dark yesterday, or about seven o&rsquo;o&rsquo;clock in the evening, the same woman was seated at her front window waiting for her husband to come home to supper. She saw two men entering this house, and a moment later she saw the reflection of a light in the dining room.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;In any other rooms?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;No, sir. Nor could she tell me anything more, for her husband came in just then and she went to supper with him.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Nick glanced toward the street.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;There is an arc light on the corner,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;I suppose, since it was evening, that the electric light enabled her to see the two men.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. I asked her about that.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Did you ask her for a description of them?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I did, sir,&rdquo; Kennedy nodded. &ldquo;She said that one appeared to be a man of middle age and was very well dressed. She also noticed that he wore a full beard.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Possibly a disguise.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The other looked a bit rough, she said, and wore a gray slouch hat, the same that the milkman found in the next yard this morning,&rdquo; said Kennedy. &ldquo;I sent an officer over to show it to her, and she readily identified it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Anything more?&rdquo; queried Nick.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;She told me he carried a suit case, also, and she judged that he had come from a distance. She noticed that the suit case appeared to be old and battered and that one of the straps was dangling, corresponding with the general&nbsp;appearance of the man himself. That was all she could tell me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Was any disturbance heard last evening by people in the neighboring houses?&rdquo; Nick asked.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Kennedy. &ldquo;I have inquired at every house.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Did the woman living opposite see from which direction the two men came?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;She did. They came around the corner and entered the front door of this house.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I see that you have unlocked it,&rdquo; Nick remarked, observing that the door then was ajar. &ldquo;Have you identified either of the two victims?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;No, sir. I have not tried, Mr. Carter, as a matter of fact, knowing that you were on your way here. By their looks&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I will size up their looks for myself, Kennedy,&rdquo; Nick interposed. &ldquo;Are things about as you found them?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Did Brady disturb anything?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;No, sir. He has been on the force long enough to know where he is at.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Very good.&rdquo; Nick turned and opened the door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;I&rsquo;ll have a look at the scene. Come with me, Chick.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Chick Carter accompanied him into the house, followed a moment later by Sergeant Kennedy and the physician.</p>\r\n<h2>CHAPTER II.<br><br><small>A PERPLEXING PROBLEM.</small></h2>\r\n<p>Nick Carter had only to enter the hall of the house to see the first signs of the sanguinary conflict of the previous night.</p>\r\n<p>On the wall opposite the dining-room door were spots and streaks of blood, great, irregular streaks and smooches, as if drops and splotches that had spurted upon the wall paper had been rubbed and spread by the garments of persons engaged in a terrific struggle. A rug near by had been kicked into a shapeless heap near the baseboard.</p>\r\n<p>Nick merely glanced at these, then paused at the open door of the dining room, in which the scene was doubly shocking.</p>\r\n<p>The roller shades of both windows had been raised, admitting the morning sunlight.</p>\r\n<p>One lamp of an electric chandelier still was burning. It looked wan and yellow in contrast with the bright light from outside.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Great guns!&rdquo; Chick Carter muttered, then at Nick&rsquo;k&rsquo;s elbow. &ldquo;What a scene of disorder.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;t&rsquo;s the limit,&rdquo; Nick tersely agreed.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Slaughter pen is right,&rdquo; added Chick, recalling the remark of the physician.</p>\r\n<p>The scene was, indeed, a shocking one. The table was out of place. Broken glasses from the sideboard strewed the floor. Chairs were overturned and broken. Spots and splashes of blood were everywhere. It stood in a great, partly dry and congealed pool on the floor between the table and the hall door&mdash;a pool in which the corpse of a murdered man was lying.</p>\r\n<p>He had fallen upon his back and was lying with face upturned in the sunlight shed through one of the windows. There was a great bruise under one eye and a gash in his cheek.</p>\r\n<p>He had been stabbed twice in the breast, and from the&nbsp;second wound still protruded the weapon used by his assailant, a knife driven home to the victim&rsquo;m&rsquo;s heart with all the merciless energy of bitter vengefulness, or utter desperation.</p>\r\n<p>He was a man in middle life and of powerful build, a smooth-shaven man of dark complexion, close-cut hair, and a hard, somewhat sinister cast of features.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Do you know him?&rdquo; asked Nick, after viewing the scene for several moments.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Chick. &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Nick stepped into the room and bent above the corpse. With the tip of his finger he lifted the dead man&rsquo;n&rsquo;s upper lip, revealing a quantity of gold bridgework on three of the teeth. He turned the left hand, also, and found that part of the third finger had been amputated.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I thought I recognized him,&rdquo; he remarked, rising and glancing again at the battered face. &ldquo;We have his photograph in our album.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; Chick questioned.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Cornelius Taggart,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;Better known to the police as Connie Taggart.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;By Jove, you&rsquo;u&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Chick declared, gazing. &ldquo;I recognize him, now. Connie Taggart, the yegg and cracksman.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;e&rsquo;s the man,&rdquo; Nick nodded. &ldquo;He has cracked his last crib and paid the price. He has been about as bad an egg, Chick, as one often finds in a basket. Have you examined this body, Doctor Boyden?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Sergeant Kennedy and the physician had approached as far as the open door.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Only superficially,&rdquo; was the physician&rsquo;n&rsquo;s reply.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;How long would you say he has been dead?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Fully twelve hours, Mr. Carter; probably longer.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The crime must have been committed last evening, then.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You raised these roller shades, Kennedy, I infer,&rdquo; said Nick, glancing at the sergeant.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I did, sir.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You found the electric lamp burning, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. I thought I had better leave it until you arrived. Aside from the two curtains, Mr. Carter, the room is as Brady found it when he entered.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Very good.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;There is the hat found in the next yard by the milkman,&rdquo; Kennedy added, pointing.</p>\r\n<p>Nick took it from a chair on which it had been tossed and began to examine it.</p>\r\n<p>It was of gray felt, much worn and defaced with grease and dirt. A twisted cord encircled it, with two small silk tassels, or the frayed remnants of them. There were two round holes through the crown, on opposite sides of it.</p>\r\n<p>Nick noted the size and examined the greasy interior. He found several short black hairs sticking to the sweat leather. The hat bore no trade-mark, however, nor any name or initial pointing to the identity of the owner.</p>\r\n<p>Nevertheless, after a brief inspection, Nick said confidently:</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The owner of this hat is a Mexican. It is like those worn by some of the Mexican troopers. He has done military service, too, as appears in these two holes through the crown. They are bullet holes.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Could they have been made last night?&rdquo; asked Chick.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;No. The edge of the felt around them is much soiled,&nbsp;which would be comparatively clean if they were so recently made.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;A bullet passed through the man&rsquo;n&rsquo;s hat in a battle, or some sort of a skirmish,&rdquo; Nick added. &ldquo;He is a man of middle size, I judge, with dark complexion and black hair.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;That answers the description the woman living opposite gave me,&rdquo; put in Kennedy. &ldquo;She saw him quite plainly when the two men came around the corner and entered the house.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;She stated that his companion wore a beard, I think you said.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;She did, Mr. Carter, and that he was well dressed.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It could not have been this man, then, unless he was in disguise,&rdquo; said Nick, glancing at Taggart&rsquo;t&rsquo;s beardless face. &ldquo;The disguise should be here, in that case, even though he removed it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I have not seen it,&rdquo; said Kennedy.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Nor the suit case brought in by his companion?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;No, sir. That is not to be found. I have looked through the house.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;There must have been several men here, Nick, judging from the fight that came off,&rdquo; Chick remarked.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, undoubtedly,&rdquo; Nick agreed. &ldquo;I am seeking evidence that might explain the fight.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It must have occurred quite soon after the two men entered.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;True.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Others must have been here when they came in, then, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; Nick interposed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;I&rsquo;ll see what more I can find.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>He crouched again above Taggart&rsquo;t&rsquo;s body and searched his pockets. Aside from a fully loaded revolver, he found only a few articles of no special significance, nor any letter or writing whatever, that might otherwise have shed a ray of light on the mystery.</p>\r\n<p>Nick then removed the weapon from the wound and examined it. It was a double-edged sheath knife with a blade about six inches long, and with an elkhorn handle. It bore no mark of any kind, though it evidently had seen considerable service.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;This undoubtedly belongs to the Mexican,&rdquo; said Nick, placing it on the table after inspecting it. &ldquo;Not one man in ten thousand in these parts carries such a knife. They&rsquo;y&rsquo;re common in Mexico, however, which further confirms my theory as to the man&rsquo;n&rsquo;s nationality.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;u&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said Chick. &ldquo;It looks very much, too, as if he killed this crook in self-defense.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;That is my opinion, Chick, at present,&rdquo; Nick replied, turning toward the hall. &ldquo;We will look farther.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;This way to the kitchen,&rdquo; said Kennedy. &ldquo;The other body is there. You can go that way, if you prefer.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The sergeant pointed to a closed door between the dining room and the kitchen, and Nick then turned in that direction.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Did you find this door closed, Kennedy, or open?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Closed, sir, just as you see it,&rdquo; said Kennedy. &ldquo;But I know it leads into the kitchen.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I judged so.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The fight evidently continued from here to the kitchen, but it was through the hall, not that way,&rdquo; Kennedy added, as Nick opened the door.</p>\r\n<p>The scene in the kitchen was equally tragic, though the room was in less disorder than the other.</p>\r\n<p>A door leading into the rear yard was wide open.</p>\r\n<p>Nearly on the threshold, so near that one foot touched it, though his head was toward the middle of the room, lay another victim of the fray of the previous night.</p>\r\n<p>He then was lying on his back, though the body evidently had been turned over since the fatality, for the pool of blood in which it had lain was at one side.</p>\r\n<p>The body was that of a man in the twenties, a well-built man in a dark plaid suit. A woolen cap had fallen from his head. His right arm was extended, the hand still holding with rigid death grip a loaded revolver.</p>\r\n<p>He had been shot through the heart.</p>\r\n<p>Both detectives immediately recognized this man, and Chick said quickly:</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;By Jove, it&rsquo;t&rsquo;s Batty Lang, Nick, the gangster. He finally has got what was coming to him.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Nick bowed without speaking, with his gaze still fixed intently upon the man on the floor. He was noting his position, the direction in which he had fallen, the weapon in his extended hand, and the outlook through the open back door.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Boyden broke the brief silence.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You appear to know this man, also, Mr. Carter,&rdquo; he said gravely.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know him,&rdquo; Nick now replied. &ldquo;His name is Bartholomew Lang. He is an East Side product, and at times has been identified with the notorious Ben Badger gang. He is more commonly called Batty Lang.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; Doctor Boyden exclaimed. &ldquo;It appears, then, that the house was filled with crooks and desperadoes last evening.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;And all here to nail that Mexican, Mr. Carter, if your theory as to his nationality is correct,&rdquo; added Kennedy. &ldquo;He must have put up an awful fight, if he got the best of them single-handed.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I thoroughly agree with you, Kennedy&mdash;if that is what he did,&rdquo; Nick said, a bit dryly.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Well, he evidently stabbed Taggart and shot this fellow, Batty Lang, as you call him,&rdquo; Kennedy confidently vouchsafed. &ldquo;He must have got away with the suit case, too, though he lost his hat in his flight. How else can you size it up?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Nick Carter did not inform him. Instead, without replying, he began a closer inspection of Lang&rsquo;g&rsquo;s body, carefully searching his several pockets, in none of which he found anything that appeared to bear in any way upon what had transpired the previous night, or what had led up to it.</p>\r\n<p>Nick noted the probable direction from which the fatal bullet had been fired, however, and also that every chamber of the revolver in the gangster&rsquo;r&rsquo;s rigid hand still contained a cartridge.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Wait here, Kennedy, both you and Doctor Boyden,&rdquo; he said, rising after making these investigations. &ldquo;I shall return in a few minutes. Come with me, Chick.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Nick led the way from the back door with the last, Chick following him. He then began an inspection of the ground in the rear yard, tracing numerous footprints to the back fence, over which he vaulted.</p>\r\n<p>There the trail appeared to divide, tracks in the greensward showing that one or more persons had fled to the left and through the grounds of an adjoining estate, while others had gone directly through the yard in the&nbsp;direction of the side street. The distance between the tracks, which were too faint to be of additional value, showed that all of these persons were running.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Follow those leading to the side street, Chick, and see what more you can learn,&rdquo; Nick directed, after calling Chick&rsquo;k&rsquo;s attention to them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;I&rsquo;ll trace the others and rejoin you out there in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Nick traced his part of the trail through the adjoining grounds, as far as a gravel walk leading to the street on which the residence fronted. There he lost it, though the fleeing men evidently had hurried to the street, where no further traces of them could be found.</p>\r\n<p>Nick then walked around the corner and rejoined Chick in the side street.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing, Nick, except these tracks of an automobile which evidently stood here for some little time last evening,&rdquo; said Chick, pointing to the ground near the curbing. &ldquo;These drippings of oil show that it remained here for some time. It would have been out of view by the woman living opposite the vacant dwelling, and it may be that the Mexican and his companion came here in it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Very possible,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;The tire marks indicate that it was a touring car. It&rsquo;t&rsquo;s about ten to one that the gang which fled this way departed in it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You speak as if you thought that there was more than one gang,&rdquo; said Chick, with a look of surprise.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;That is precisely what I think.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;For what reason?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Several,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;Circumstances indicate, to begin with, that the house was obtained from the broker, Gibson, only in order to turn a knavish trick on some one. Naturally, if that is true, we must infer that the Mexican was to be the victim of the job.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Surely, since he was brought there and evidently had come from a distance, possibly all the way from Mexico,&rdquo; said Chick.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The evidence in the house shows plainly, however, that four or five men were there, possibly more,&rdquo; Nick continued. &ldquo;A less number could not have put up such a fight, nor have caused so much destruction, in the brief time in which it must have occurred.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I agree with you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It is obvious, too, that the Mexican could not have licked half a dozen men single-handed, surely not such desperate men as Connie Taggart and Batty Lang.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; replied Chick decidedly. &ldquo;They would have downed him right off the reel.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;He must have had help, then,&rdquo; Nick reasoned. &ldquo;That is why I think there were two factions in the fight. I mean, of course, two different gangs.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Both out to get the Mexican?&rdquo; questioned Chick.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;I&rsquo;m not sure about that, though it now appears so,&rdquo; Nick replied. &ldquo;What they were going to gain by getting him is also an open question.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Decidedly.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Be that as it may, Chick, he evidently stabbed Taggart and undertook to escape in great haste. Otherwise he would not have left his knife in the yegg&rsquo;g&rsquo;s breast.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Surely not.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The stabbing may have precipitated the fight, or have occurred after the fight began,&rdquo; Nick proceeded. &ldquo;There is no way by which that can be immediately determined. It continued through the hall and into the kitchen, where&nbsp;Batty Lang was shot. Here, now, is an important point. It further indicates that there were two gangs in the house.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;What point is that?&rdquo; Chick inquired.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You saw where Lang was lying, with his feet near the open door and his head toward the middle of the room. He pitched forward on his face when shot, as the blood on the floor plainly shows.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;True. That was very evident.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The bullet entered his breast, and came from the direction of the hall door,&rdquo; Nick went on. &ldquo;Obviously, then, he was facing the hall, with his back to the rear door of the house. That position, together with the fact that he had a revolver in his hand, convinces me that he was attempting to prevent others, presumably including the person who shot him, from following others who had fled through the back door, probably including the Mexican.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;By Jove, that does appear logical,&rdquo; said Chick. &ldquo;That may explain how the Mexican got away with his suit case.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I think I am right, Chick, despite that the case opens up a wide held for conjectures,&rdquo; Nick replied. &ldquo;I did not inform Kennedy and the physician, however, for we may find it of advantage to keep his theory to ourselves.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Quite likely,&rdquo; Chick agreed.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The matter must be sifted to the bottom.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;I&rsquo;m with you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We will return to the house, now, and wait until Gibson arrives,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;He can supply us with a clew, perhaps, to the persons who pretended they wanted to rent the house. He can give us a description of them, at least.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Most likely,&rdquo; said Chick, as they moved on. &ldquo;It may be, Nick, that Taggart and Lang were confederates in a job to get the Mexican, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;n&rsquo;t think they were confederates,&rdquo; Nick interposed.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Because I feel sure that Taggart was killed by the Mexican, and his escape and the evidence that Lang was preventing others from pursuing him, indicate that Lang was not a confederate of Taggart, but was opposed to him. No other deduction would be consistent with all of the circumstances.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;t&rsquo;s right, too,&rdquo; Chick quickly nodded. &ldquo;I see the point.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Lang has been identified at times with the Ben Badger gang,&rdquo; Nick added. &ldquo;Badger is a tough ticket, also that notorious sister of his, Sadie Badger. They&rsquo;y&rsquo;re the kingpins of about as bad a bunch as can be found in the East Side.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Right again, Nick.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I never have heard, however, that Connie Taggart was friendly with them. If any of them were with Lang last night, we may be able to find positive evidence of it and to force a squeal from them. Otherwise&mdash;hello!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Nick broke off abruptly when they turned the corner, and Chick also saw the occasion for it.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;There is Patsy, and&mdash;yes, by Jove, it&rsquo;t&rsquo;s Frank Mantell. What the deuce has sent them here?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The touring car containing Patsy Garvan and Mantell,&nbsp;driven by the latter&rsquo;r&rsquo;s chauffeur, had just swerved to the sidewalk near the house in which the two murders had been committed.</p>\r\n<h2>CHAPTER III.<br><br><small>THE MAN FROM MEXICO.</small></h2>\r\n<p>Nick Carter hastened to join Patsy and Frank Mantell, pausing at the latter&rsquo;r&rsquo;s touring car to learn the occasion for his visit. He had not long to wait, for Mantell hardly took time to greet him.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You must throw up this murder case, Nick; you really must, and take on a matter in which I am desperately interested,&rdquo; he forcibly insisted. &ldquo;More than half a million dollars are at stake. They&rsquo;y&rsquo;re hopelessly lost, in fact, unless you can trace and recover them. You must drop this case and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Nick interposed, after intently regarding him. &ldquo;Keep your head. Who has lost so much money, and when?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;t&rsquo;s not money,&rdquo; Mantell replied, in hurried undertones. &ldquo;It&rsquo;t&rsquo;s a collection of old jewels of vast value, which was obtained under most extraordinary circumstances. I cannot inform you in detail out here, Nick, where I might be overheard by others. Come with me to my residence, where&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Presently, perhaps,&rdquo; Nick again interrupted. &ldquo;Come into this house, instead, where we can occupy one of the chambers. I then will hear what you have to say.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Mantell did not wait for the invitation to be repeated. He sprang out of the car before it was fairly uttered, then accompanied the detective to the house, followed by Chick and Patsy.</p>\r\n<p>Nick lingered only to inform Sergeant Kennedy that he had other business for a few minutes, directing him to take charge of the house while he was engaged, and he then led his three companions to a front chamber and closed the door.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Now, Mantell, out with it as briefly as possible,&rdquo; said he, when they were seated. &ldquo;What is this matter in which you are so desperately interested?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>He had read in Mantell&rsquo;l&rsquo;s pale face the depths of his anxiety and distress, and knowing him to have a level head and excellent judgment and discretion, he reasoned that it must be a matter of extraordinary importance.</p>\r\n<p>Mantell hastened to obey him.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It began, Nick, with a letter I received about ten days ago from an old college chum of mine, Calvin Vandyke, a man able in every way to judge of what he wrote me,&rdquo; he said earnestly. &ldquo;Unfortunately, however, I haven&rsquo;n&rsquo;t the letter in my pocket. It is in the desk in my library.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Well, well, what is it about?&rdquo; Nick inquired. &ldquo;Where is Mr. Vandyke?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;He now is in Mexico City, under so important a contract that he cannot possibly leave the country for several months.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Mexico City, eh?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Nick shot a swift, furtive glance at Chick, so significant that the latter suppressed a look of surprise and remained silent.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Mantell quickly nodded. &ldquo;The letter he wrote me explained all that, Nick, and why he made me his partner in this matter, giving me an equal interest with him and the third party involved.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Who is the third party?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;A Mexican named Juan Padillo, recently a soldier in Villa&rsquo;a&rsquo;s forces during the campaign in northern Mexico. He has deserted, and now is in this city. That is to say&mdash;if he still is in the land of the living. I&rsquo;I&rsquo;m far from sure of it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Explain,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;Why did Juan Padillo become a deserter?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Because of a find he made during the sacking of an old monastery in Chihuahua territory, after the subjection of that section in which it is located and the flight of most of the inhabitants. Vandyke has quietly looked up the legal side of the matter, and he finds that the retention of these spoils of war is entirely legitimate. In other words, Juan Padillo has a right to retain his prize and dispose of it to the best advantage.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Admitting that, Mantell, what are the other circumstances?&rdquo; Nick inquired.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;They may be briefly stated. Padillo made this find in a secret vault, which he discovered entirely by chance, under a wine cellar in the monastery. He was the only person in Mexico who knew of his discovery and that he got away with his plunder, with the single exception of Calvin Vandyke, with whom Padillo long has had friendly relations, and to whom he turned for aid and advice.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Of what do these spoils of war, as you call them, consist?&rdquo; Nick questioned.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I can give you only an idea, Nick, without referring to Vandyke&rsquo;e&rsquo;s letter, which describes the articles in detail and estimates their value,&rdquo; said Mantell. &ldquo;They consist of clerical robes and jewels of great antiquity, which, Vandyke has learned, must have been brought from Spain as far back as the sixteenth century, and which probably have since been kept in concealment in the monastery vault.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Give me an idea of them.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Well, one article is an archbishop&rsquo;p&rsquo;s robe of purple, wrought with a design in diamonds, emeralds, rubies, and pearls. The gems are mounted in gold, covering the entire breast of the robe, with a design consisting of the ancient Spanish coat of arms, the double eagles back to back, with wings raised and beaks open.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I recall it,&rdquo; Nick nodded.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;There are two gold crowns, also, lavishly mounted with diamonds, emeralds, and sapphires, the most of which are of unusual size and corresponding value. In addition to these are other clerical robes of purple and white silk, all worked with gems the worth of which could only be roughly estimated. Vandyke places the value of the entire prize, however, at about six hundred thousand dollars.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Gee whiz!&rdquo; Patsy quietly exclaimed. &ldquo;That sure was some find.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Juan Padillo was much dazzled by it, of course, and scarce knew what to do,&rdquo; Mantell earnestly continued. &ldquo;He did not dare to confide in any of his countrymen. He determined to take advantage of the prize, however, and to get out of the country with it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;How long ago was that?&rdquo; Nick inquired.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Nearly two months. He obtained an old leather suit case, in which he packed the spoils, and with which he succeeded in reaching Mexico City, where he at once sought Vandyke and confided in him, offering to share equally with him in return for his advice and assistance.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Vandyke looked into the matter, keeping Padillo concealed in his residence,&rdquo; Mantell went on. &ldquo;He then realized the vast value of the prize, but being utterly unable to leave the country himself, he proposed including me in the matter on an equal footing, telling Padillo that he could come to me and that I would dispose of the gems at their market value. Padillo eagerly accepted the proposal, knowing that he would be shot as a deserter, if caught, and that he must lose no time in getting out of the country.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I follow you,&rdquo; Nick put in.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Vandyke then smuggled him to Vera Cruz, and finally got him on board a schooner about to leave for New York, paying his passage and giving him careful instructions.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Namely?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;He directed him not to leave the vessel after his arrival here until I called for him, also not to open the suit case until he was safe in my residence, and to pretend all the while that he was a penniless Mexican on his way to join relatives in this city.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;All were wise precautions,&rdquo; Nick remarked.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Vandyke then sent me a letter, stating all of these facts and invited me to co&ouml;perate with him,&rdquo; Mantell continued. &ldquo;Naturally, with two hundred thousand dollars in view, I was more than glad to comply. I wrote Vandyke to that effect, and since have been constantly on the watch for the arrival of the vessel. She was docked at Gray&rsquo;y&rsquo;s wharf late yesterday afternoon. But I did not learn of it until I read the shipping news this morning. I then rushed down to the wharf with my touring car, only to learn that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;That Juan Padillo left the vessel soon after her arrival yesterday and in company with a man who used your name,&rdquo; said Nick, interrupting.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; Mantell exclaimed, with a gasp. &ldquo;How did you know that?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Your anxiety, coupled with the fact that Padillo was to remain on the vessel until you called for him, admits of no other deductions,&rdquo; Nick replied evasively.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You are right, Carter, perfectly right,&rdquo; Mantell said, with a groan. &ldquo;Padillo left the vessel about six o&rsquo;o&rsquo;clock last evening, taking with him the suit case containing his plunder.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;With a man who used your name?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Who informed you?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The captain of the vessel.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;What more could he tell you?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Only that Padillo had, as I then could judge, carefully followed the directions Vandyke had given him. Captain Macy evidently knew nothing about the contents of the suit case, and he said it was the only piece of luggage the Mexican had, and that he had taken it ashore. He could give me only a vague description of the man who called for him, and said that Padillo appeared relieved and eager to accompany him. They left from the head of the wharf in a touring car, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;t&rsquo;s all you know about them,&rdquo; Nick again interrupted.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I admit that, Carter, and that&rsquo;t&rsquo;s why I want your aid,&rdquo; Mantell said earnestly. &ldquo;This man and the suit case must be found. I never can look Vandyke in the face. Think of it! If&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;t&rsquo;s what I am doing,&rdquo; said Nick, smiling a bit oddly. &ldquo;Now, Mantell, answer my questions. I then may do&nbsp;something more than think. Whom have you told about this matter?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Only three persons,&rdquo; Mantell quickly asserted. &ldquo;My wife and my parents, with whom Helen and I have been living since our marriage. You knew, of course, that I was married eight weeks ago to Helen Bailey, the pretty telephone girl whom you served so kindly&mdash;and who, I may add, thinks so well of you Carters.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, I know all about that, Mantell, but it&rsquo;t&rsquo;s irrelevant just now,&rdquo; smiled Nick. &ldquo;Did you caution your parents, however, to say nothing about the matter?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I did so most impressively.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Do you think they have obeyed you?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, positively.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Where did you talk with them about it?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;At home, Nick, in the library.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You must have been overheard.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;n&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I know so,&rdquo; Nick insisted. &ldquo;Either that, Mantell, or the letter sent you by Vandyke has been read by one of your servants, or by some outsider. In no other way, if your wife and parents have been silent on the subject, could the man who lured Juan Padillo from the vessel and used your name have learned anything about the matter.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I confess that I am mystified, Carter, as well as filled with dismay,&rdquo; Mantell hopelessly admitted. &ldquo;You are the only one to whom I can turn. What can be done? How can&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Stop a moment,&rdquo; Nick interposed, rising abruptly. &ldquo;There is nothing in further discussing the case. Return to your car, Mantell, and wait until I rejoin you. Go with him, Patsy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Which may mean that you will&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Look into the matter?&rdquo; Nick cut in again. &ldquo;Yes, I will do what I can for you. Time is of value, moreover, so don&rsquo;n&rsquo;t delay to thank me. Go at once.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Patsy led the way, Mantell following, with an expression of great relief on his refined, attractive face.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Well, by Jove, that sheds limelight on this murder mystery,&rdquo; said Chick, lingering briefly with Nick in the chamber. &ldquo;This certainly is a remarkable coincidence.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I suspected something of the kind, Chick, when he mentioned the loss of a vast quantity of jewels,&rdquo; Nick replied. &ldquo;That was one reason why I consented to hear his story.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You have no doubt, of course, that the Mexican who was here last evening was Juan Padillo.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Not the slightest.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Lured here by crooks who had learned of the circumstances and been watching for the vessel.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Exactly. They were more alert than Mantell, and got in their work ahead of him.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;But how do you size up what occurred here?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;I&rsquo;m not quite ready to say,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;I am going with Mantell to his residence. You remain here and get what information Gibson can impart. Have a look in the meantime at the doors and windows of the house. There may be evidence indicating that it was broken into by some of the rascals afterward engaged in the fight.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;I&rsquo;ll find it, Nick, if there is any,&rdquo; Chick confidently predicted. &ldquo;I see at what you are driving.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Have Kennedy summon the coroner, also, and direct him to take the customary legal steps here,&rdquo; Nick added. &ldquo;Say nothing about what we have learned and suspect,&nbsp;but tell him we will continue our investigations, and report later.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;I&rsquo;ve got you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Having taken those steps, rejoin me at Mantell&rsquo;l&rsquo;s residence as quickly as possible,&rdquo; Nick directed. &ldquo;He lives&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I know the house. It&rsquo;t&rsquo;s the mansion built by Mantell, the senior, in Riverside Drive,&rdquo; Chick put in. &ldquo;I will lose no time in following you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I will go with Mantell in his car, leaving Danny to bring you in ours,&rdquo; said Nick, as both turned from the chamber. &ldquo;There must be quick work done on this case, or, unless I am much mistaken, both Juan Padillo and his war prize of ancient jewels will go by the board.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Quick work, then, is the proper caper,&rdquo; Chick declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;I&rsquo;ll see you a little later.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Nick did not reply, but hastened out to the car in which Patsy and Frank Mantell were waiting.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;To your residence,&rdquo; he directed, addressing the latter. &ldquo;Let her go at top speed, chauffeur. Minutes count.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br><br><small>A STARTLING DISCOVERY.</small></h2>\r\n<p>It was nearly noon when the touring car containing Nick Carter and his companions sped up the broad driveway and stopped under the porte-coch&egrave;re of the magnificent Mantell mansion overlooking the Hudson.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We shall not find my father at home, Nick,&rdquo; Mantell remarked, while alighting from the car. &ldquo;He still is engaged in settling up the affairs of our defunct department store, wrecked by the knavery of his junior partner, that treacherous miscreant, Gaston Goulard. No need to tell you of that rascal, Nick, whom you so quickly pulled up to the ringbolt after taking on the case.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;No need, indeed,&rdquo; Nick replied, a bit grimly. &ldquo;It was deucedly unfortunate, though, that he slipped through the meshes of the legal net and eluded the punishment he deserved.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Decidedly so.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;His being a partner in the business was all that saved him,&rdquo; Nick added. &ldquo;It enabled a clever criminal lawyer to pull him out of the fire, on grounds that either of the partners had a legal right to dispose at will of the property of the firm. It was a hard fight, and the rascal got away without punishment, barring the penalty he had brought upon himself, that of financial ruin and hopeless dishonor.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Right in both respects,&rdquo; Mantell nodded. &ldquo;Gaston Goulard is down and out forever.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;By the way, Mantell, do you ever see him?&rdquo; Nick inquired.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, occasionally,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I never see him, however, that he does not threaten to get even with me for the past.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; Nick ejaculated contemptuously.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Get even, indeed!&rdquo; Mantell bitterly added. &ldquo;The boot should be on the other leg. He hates me for having won and married Helen Bailey, Nick, to whose hand he had aspirations even while engaged in his treacherous robberies. I saw him about ten days ago, looking seedy enough, Nick, and as if dissipation was making inroads upon his health.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Threatened you, Mantell, has he?&rdquo; questioned Nick, with brows knitting slightly.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Repeatedly,&rdquo; Mantell nodded, as they mounted the steps. &ldquo;I somehow fear the rascal, Nick, for he is capable of any degree of knavery, and is a desperate dog when crossed. I expect trouble from him, in fact, and for that reason am constantly alert.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I predicted after his exposure and arrest that he would go to the bad,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;Ah, this is a pleasure, indeed, Mrs. Mantell.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Having entered the handsomely furnished house while speaking, where they were met in the hall by Mantell&rsquo;l&rsquo;s charming young wife, the beautiful girl whom Nick first had seen at a telephone switchboard, under circumstances that revealed her lofty and heroic character, as well as which enabled him to be of great service to her.</p>\r\n<p>She hastened to shake hands with both him and Patsy, saying feelingly:</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Your pleasure could not be greater than mine, Mr. Carter. I am delighted to see you. I ought to scold you roundly, however, for not having called here occasionally, at least.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;t&rsquo;s right, too, Helen,&rdquo; put in Mantell.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You overlook one fact,&rdquo; smiled Nick, replying to her.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;What is that, Mr. Carter?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;That I have hardly an hour in the week, not to say in a day, that I can really call my own,&rdquo; Nick said gravely. &ldquo;I am a very busy man, you know.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ah, I suppose so,&rdquo; Helen rejoined. &ldquo;And chiefly because other men are so wicked.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;True.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It is deplorable.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;True again,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;Nor am I less busy than usual this morning. I think, Frank, we had better get right at this matter.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I think so, too.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;I&rsquo;m sure your wife will excuse us.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>She bowed and smiled agreeably, and Nick and Patsy followed Mantell into the library, a superbly furnished room overlooking the side grounds.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Now, Nick, what can I tell you?&rdquo; he asked, placing chairs for them. &ldquo;Why have you come here?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;To begin with, Mantell, I want to see the letter written to you by Calvin Vandyke,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;Where have you kept it?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Here, in my desk,&rdquo; said Mantell, rising to unlock a large roll-top desk in one corner of the spacious room.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Is your desk usually locked?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Always, Nick, when I am absent.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Wait one moment,&rdquo; said the detective. &ldquo;Let me examine the lock.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Mantell complied, handing him the key.</p>\r\n<p>Nick unlocked the desk, and, rolling the top partly up, he began a careful inspection of the brass socket which received the bolt of the lock when the desk was securely closed. He found several tiny, faint scratches on one side of it, which could not have been caused by the action of the bolt, not being where it came in contact with the socket. An examination with a powerful lens, moreover, showed that these slight marks were quite bright, as if recently made and with an instrument as sharp as the point of a pin.</p>\r\n<p>Nick returned the ring of keys and resumed his seat.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;That lock has recently been picked, Mantell,&rdquo; he said confidently.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Picked!&rdquo; Mantell exclaimed amazedly. &ldquo;Are you sure of it?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Positively.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;n&rsquo;t any buts,&rdquo; Nick interrupted. &ldquo;I know when evidence shows that a lock has been picked. The crook who picked that one used a tool with a sharp point, which at times touched one side of the bolt socket and left faint marks in the brass. The brightness of them shows that it was quite recently done.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;But our servants are entirely trustworthy, Nick, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;n&rsquo;t think it was done by one of your servants,&rdquo; Nick again interrupted. &ldquo;Have you a burglar alarm in the house?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, an electric alarm,&rdquo; said Mantell. &ldquo;All of the doors and windows on the ground floor are protected. Perkins, the butler, sets it each night before he retires.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;This job may have been done during the day.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;But there is always some one in the house.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I will look farther presently,&rdquo; said Nick, not inclined to argue the point. &ldquo;Let me see the Vandyke letter, also the envelope, if you have it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Mantell took them from a pigeonhole in the desk and placed them in the detective&rsquo;e&rsquo;s hand.</p>\r\n<p>Nick turned to the window and began to inspect them with his lens, which he had not replaced in his pocket. He did not read the letter, which covered several closely written sheets, and in which he apparently had no interest aside from the paper on which it was written.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;A man handling a tool small enough to pick the lock of a desk is very likely to soil the balls of his thumb and fingers with the metal,&rdquo; he remarked, after several moments. &ldquo;There are faint marks and smooches both on this envelope and the backs of several sheets of the paper.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I did not observe them,&rdquo; said Mantell, noting the detective&rsquo;e&rsquo;s subtle intonation. &ldquo;What do you make of them, Carter?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;They look very much like finger prints,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;Patsy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, chief.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Patsy had foreseen what was coming and was alert on the instant.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Mantell&rsquo;l&rsquo;s car is waiting outside,&rdquo; said Nick, folding the letter and replacing it in the envelope. &ldquo;His chauffeur will take you to our office and bring you back here. Examine these smooches with a magnifying glass and see what you make of them. If finger prints, compare them with our collection. Report as quickly as possible.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Trust me for that, chief,&rdquo; cried Patsy, hastening from the room.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;While we are waiting, Mantell, I will have a look around the outside of the house,&rdquo; said Nick, rising. &ldquo;I may find evidence that it has been recently entered, in spite of your burglar alarm. You had better wait here. I can work more quickly alone.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Nick walked out through the hall after the last remark, and ten minutes had passed, when he returned.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; questioned Mantell anxiously. &ldquo;What have you found?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Nothing positively showing that the house was entered by night,&rdquo; Nick replied, resuming his seat. &ldquo;It may have been accomplished through a second-story window, however, several of which can be quite easily reached. I found, nevertheless, positive evidence of something else.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Of what?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;That two men quite recently were playing the eavesdropper under your library windows,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;There are partly obliterated footprints in the greensward and the flower beds flanking the foundation wall below the windows.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;By Jove, is it possible!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;If they were under only one window, I would feel less confident,&rdquo; Nick added. &ldquo;The fact that traces of the same impressions appear under all of the windows convinces me that I am right. They were spying outside ten evenings ago.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;How do you fix the exact day?&rdquo; Mantell questioned perplexedly.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;By the character of the imprints and the condition of the near greensward, to which they frequently stepped,&rdquo; Nick explained. &ldquo;We had a hard rain eleven days ago, and have had none since then.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I remember.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;A hard rain would completely obliterate such imprints from the soil of a flower bed,&rdquo; Nick went on. &ldquo;These, then, must have been formed since the storm. The depth and irregular character of them, however, show that the soil must have been very soft and muddy, as if very soon after the rain. This appears, too, in that when they stepped to the greensward they left many traces of the soil clinging to their soles. I feel perfectly safe in saying that they were there the night after the storm.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Mantell&rsquo;l&rsquo;s face had taken on a more serious expression.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;By Jove, you have reminded me of something, Carter,&rdquo; he said gravely.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It was on the day following that storm that I received Vandyke&rsquo;e&rsquo;s letter, and I read it aloud that evening to my wife and parents. We were here in the library. I begin to think your deductions are correct.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I am very sure of it,&rdquo; Nick declared, smiling a bit oddly.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;But who could have been spying upon us, or playing the eavesdropper?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;There were two men, Mantell, judging from the different imprints, or what little is left of them,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;They may have been here with some other object in view, possibly the planning of a burglary. Their hearing that letter, however, may have been only incidental, though it evidently resulted in a change of their plans for an entirely different job.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You mean that of getting and robbing Juan Padillo.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;But why do you suspect that a burglary was contemplated?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Because a notorious burglar, one of the most dangerous yeggs in the country, was killed last night in a house in Manhattanville,&rdquo; Nick now explained. &ldquo;I refer to Cornelius Taggart, quite commonly known as Connie Taggart, the cracksman.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; Mantell&rsquo;l&rsquo;s color had been steadily waning. &ldquo;You imply, Carter, that he may have been one of the eavesdroppers, that he may have been the scoundrel who used my name to deceive Juan Padillo.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Either he, Mantell, or his confederate,&rdquo; bowed Nick. &ldquo;That is precisely what I think.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;But why? For any other reason?&rdquo; Mantell asked anxiously.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, a very potent reason,&rdquo; nodded the detective. &ldquo;Listen, Mantell, and I will tell why I think so.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Nick then informed him of what had been discovered in the Manhattanville house, the evidence he had found, and many of the conclusions at which he had arrived.</p>\r\n<p>Mantell listened without interrupting, but with steadily increasing apprehensions, as appeared in the look of despair that finally settled on his drawn, white face.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;There is nothing to it, Carter,&rdquo; he said, with a groan, when Nick had concluded. &ldquo;They have got both the man and the jewels. They have killed Padillo, and the jewels are gone forever.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be so sure of that,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;I may find a way to save the man and recover the gems. That&rsquo;t&rsquo;s what I am seeking&mdash;the way.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I mean that I want to discover, if possible, the identity of Taggart&rsquo;t&rsquo;s confederate,&rdquo; Nick interrupted. &ldquo;I then can shape up my work. That is why I came here to see Vandyke&rsquo;e&rsquo;s letter. I suspect that a copy of it was made. I suspected, also, if it was obtained by breaking into the house and forcing your desk, that it might bear finger prints of the crooks. Patsy will report a little later.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;But why wouldn&rsquo;n&rsquo;t a crook have taken the letter itself?&rdquo; questioned Mantell. &ldquo;Why would he have made a copy of it?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Because you would have missed the letter, and, of course, would have become suspicious,&rdquo; Nick pointed out. &ldquo;You would immediately have taken steps to thwart the knavery that has been successfully accomplished through leaving the letter in its customary place.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I see,&rdquo; Mantell nodded. &ldquo;I ought to have thought of that. You suspect then, that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Wait! There comes my touring car with Chick and Danny, my chauffeur,&rdquo; Nick interrupted, glancing from the window. &ldquo;I must see what more he has learned.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I will admit him,&rdquo; cried Mantell, hastening to do so.</p>\r\n<p>Chick entered the library with him a few moments later. He at once proceeded to report to Nick that Gibson, the house broker, could add nothing definite to the statements he had made by telephone, and that his description of the couple who had called to rent the house were of but little value, the woman having been veiled at the time, while the man probably was in disguise.</p>\r\n<p>On one of the basement windows, however, Chick had found convincing evidence that the house had been forcibly entered, but he could discover no clew to the identity or number of the burglars.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Whether they were confederates of Taggart or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;They were not,&rdquo; said Nick, interrupting Chick&rsquo;k&rsquo;s report. &ldquo;Taggart was killed by Padillo, and he either was the man who lured the Mexican to the house, or a confederate of the man who did so. In either case, Chick, the Taggart gang would have had access to the house without breaking into it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;t&rsquo;s logical,&rdquo; Chick quickly admitted. &ldquo;There is no denying it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;If we can discover the identity of Taggart&rsquo;t&rsquo;s confederate, therefore, we shall have a definite clew to both gangs that evidently were in the house,&rdquo; Nick added. &ldquo;Ah, Patsy is returning. Admit him, Mantell. His haste indicates that he has made a discovery of some importance.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Nick had caught sight of the returning automobile, from which Patsy was hastening to alight before it came to a&nbsp;stop in the driveway. He entered the library a moment later, and his first words confirmed Nick&rsquo;k&rsquo;s prediction.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;They are finger prints, chief, all right,&rdquo; he cried, returning the Vandyke letter.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Are there corresponding ones in our collection?&rdquo; Nick inquired.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;t&rsquo;s what, chief.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Whose are they, Patsy?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Those of the crook who gave the law the slip, but not before we got his measurements and identification marks,&rdquo; cried Patsy. &ldquo;There is no mistaking them, chief. They are the finger prints of&mdash;Gaston Goulard!&rdquo;</p>",

  "contentText": "CHAPTER I\nA MIDNIGHT VISITOR\n\nI became mixed up with the Clevedon case—the Cartordale Mystery, as it has been called—in curious fashion.  True, it was to some\nextent in my line of business, though I do not actually earn my living by straightening out tangles.  With me it is all a matter\nof “copy.”\n\nYou may or may not have read my various books—there are eight of them now—on criminology.  Their preparation has led me into all\nsorts of queer by-ways and has given me a curiously clear and analytical insight into the mind of the criminal.  I have solved\nmany mysteries—you will forgive the apparent boastfulness, but I have no useful Watson to detail my exploits—but I stop there,\nwith solving p. 10them, I mean.  When I know the answer, I hand the whole matter over to the police.  “There is your man (or\nwoman)—take him,” I say.  And sometimes they do take him—and hang him.  But occasionally they reply, “But we can’t take him—we\ncouldn’t prove it against him.”  That, however, is no business of mine.  I am a scientist, not a police official, and have nothing\nto do with the foolery of their law courts or the flummery of what they call their rules of evidence.\n\nI have supplied the answer to the conundrum and that suffices me.  The mystery and its solution go into my notebooks, to be used\neventually for my own purpose, it may be to illustrate a theory, or perhaps to demonstrate a scientific fact.  I have no desire to\npose and no intention of posing as a worker of miracles.\n\nThere is nothing marvellous about my methods nor wonderful in the results.  I do but proceed from fact to fact, as you will see in\nthis narrative, wherein I have set forth exactly what happened, however foolish it may make me look.  The reader will accompany me\nstep by step in my investigation of the Clevedon mystery and will learn precisely how the solution, which so bewildered and\nastonished the little group in Cartordale, came to me.  You p. 11will see me groping in the dark, then you will discover, as I\ndid, a pin-point of light which grows wider and wider until the whole story stands revealed.  And if you guess the solution before\nI did, that will show that you are a cleverer detective than I am, which may very easily be.\n\nI did not, by the way, go to Cartordale for the purpose of investigating this particular mystery.  I became involved in it almost\ninvoluntarily.  It was a queerly tangled skein enough, and that of itself would have been sufficient fascination to drag me into\nit, though I was deep in it long before any intention or even desire to solve the puzzle manifested itself.  As a rule I carefully\nselect my cases.  Some appeal to me, others do not.  But in this instance I was not entirely a free agent.  I was in it before I\nquite knew where I was going.  That being so, it may be interesting to explain how I came to be at Cartordale at all.\n\nMy Aunt Emily, to put it briefly, left me the house and the money that took me into the wilds of Peakshire.  I had never met her\nin the flesh, and she, as far as I know, had never set eyes on me.  In point of fact, she never forgave my father for taking to\nhimself a second wife after my mother died.  But that is family p. 12history and dry stuff.  Aunt Emily made amends for past\nneglect by her will.  She left me about eight hundred a year from investments, and the house at Cartordale, both very useful,\nthough I was not exactly a poor man.  My books have provided me with a fairly steady income for some years.\n\nStone Hollow, the house I had inherited, was a square, rather gloomy-looking building—outwardly sombre, at all events—situated at\nthe head of Cartordale, a wild and romantic valley in the heart of Peakshire, some sixteen miles from the large industrial city of\nMidlington.  The name, Stone Hollow, had a comparatively recent derivation, arising from the fact that the house was built on the\nsite of, and largely on the profits from, a now disused stone quarry.\n\nThe house itself stood on a sort of broad shelf, and behind it a tall hill sprang almost perpendicularly upwards, still showing on\nits face the marks and scars of former quarrying operations, though Nature was already busy trying to hide the evidences of man’s\nvandalism behind a cover of green and brown.  Before the house, the ground sloped gently downwards towards the Dale, while to the\nleft was a stretch of heather clad moorland lying between Stone Hollow and White Towers, the residence of Sir Philip Clevedon.\n\np. 13It sounds rather well in description, but I will frankly confess that after a very few days at Cartordale I was bored. \nThough I had travelled widely, I had never actually lived out of London and was always very quickly eager to be back there.  At\nfirst, I had done my best to persuade myself that a country life was really the ideal and that it would provide me with quiet and\nisolation that would be useful for literary work.  But I soon arrived at the limit of my resources in self-deception.  Which\nbrings me to the night of February 23rd.\n\nI was lolling on the couch in the room I had made my study, pretending to work and succeeding very badly.\n\n“Nothing ever happens in a place like this,” I said aloud, with a yawn.  “I should become a hopeless vegetable if I lived here.  I\ncouldn’t even write another book.  There isn’t a chapter in the whole blessed place.  Neither robbery nor murder ever happens. \nThe folk wouldn’t know the meaning of the words without looking them up in a dictionary.  Honesty is the badge of all their tribe,\nand honesty, if commendable, is dull.”\n\nI took up a batch of manuscript from the desk at my elbow and began to read in rather desultory fashion, making a correction here\nand there with a pencil.\n\np. 14“Another delusion shattered,” I murmured.  “They say one can write so much better in the quiet of the country than amid the\nbustle and distractions of town.  That is bunkum.  This one can’t, anyway.  I thought I would have made a good start with this\nbook, but I have done next to nothing, and what there is of it is rotten.  I could do more work in a week in London than I shall\ndo in three months of this.  I think I’ll be getting back next week.”\n\nBut I was wrong in saying that nothing ever happened in Cartordale.  Adventure was even at that moment coming towards me with very\nhurried footsteps.\n\nThe time—it is essential always to be precise in details—was fifty-three minutes past eleven, and the date February 23rd.\n\nIt came, the beginning of the story, with a quick, almost peremptory tapping on the window-pane and then the bottom sash was\nslowly pushed up.  I turned to the desk and took a revolver from one of the small drawers, then strode across the room and raised\nthe blind with a quick rattle, half expecting that my visitor would reveal himself in the shape of a burglar.  What I saw brought\neven me to a standstill, little susceptible as I am to surprises of any sort.\n\np. 15My visitor was not a burglar—at least, not a male of that species—but a girl, who looked young enough to be in her teens,\nthough she may have been a year or two outside them, and a great deal too pretty to be wandering about alone at that time of\nnight.  She was wearing a long, sleeveless cloak and a grey, woollen cap, from beneath which part of her hair had escaped and was\nblowing about her face in little wisps of bronze-gold cloud.\n\n“Let me in,” she whispered.  “Please—I have hurt myself and I am afraid to go on.”\n\nI stretched out my hands and, placing them beneath her arms, lifted her over the low window-sill and into the room.\n\n“How strong you are,” she murmured.\n\nBut even as she said that, the something that had kept her up gave way and she lay a limp, dead weight in my clasp.  I carried her\nto the couch, but as I placed her down and began to unfasten the long, grey cloak, I noticed that the sleeve of her white blouse\nwas stained with blood.  That was evidently the hurt to which she had referred; and I began to wonder whether I had not better\nsummon my housekeeper.  It looked essentially a case for feminine aid.  The girl, however, was already recovering.\n\np. 16“No, come here,” she said, as I began to move towards the door.\n\nI returned to her side and gently lifted her arm.\n\n“Yes, you have hurt yourself,” I remarked.  “See—your arm, isn’t it?—there is blood—”\n\n“Yes, it’s my arm,” she replied, lifting her cloak and showing a ragged tear in the blouse on the under-side of the sleeve.  “It’s\nnot very bad—I think—but it seems to be bleeding a good deal, and I—I am afraid of blood.”\n\n“May I look at it?” I asked.  “I could perhaps bandage it, and—”\n\n“Are you a doctor—how nice!” she cried.\n\n“No,” I replied with a smile, “I am not a doctor.  But I am a first-aid expert, enough of one, anyway, to say whether or not a\ndoctor is necessary.  Yes, I have treated much bigger injuries than this.  It is only a scratch, I fancy, and the blood looks more\nthan it really is.  A very little blood makes a mess of things.  Lie still a minute.  I have everything here within reach and\nwe’ll soon put you right.”\n\nI brought a pair of scissors and cut away the sleeve, finding the arm beneath it—the left arm, by the way—rather badly gashed.\n\n“To-morrow you must show that to a doctor,” I said when I had washed and bandaged p. 17it.  “Now I will give you a glass of wine\nand—”\n\n“Is there anyone but you in the house?” the girl asked abruptly, as if some thought had suddenly occurred to her.\n\n“There is my housekeeper,” I said, “and a maid.  Shall I rouse them and—?”\n\n“Mercy, no!” she exclaimed.  “Whatever would they say if they found me here—at this time of night—?”\n\nI nodded, quite comprehending the hint so conveyed.\n\n“I have been visiting a friend,” she went on, observing me keenly through her drooping eyelashes, perhaps to see how I took the\nstory, “and I—I lost my way.”\n\n“Your friends should not have allowed you to attempt to find it by yourself,” I returned.\n\n“My friends are not plural,” she retorted with a little trill of laughter.  “They—or rather she—she is a maiden lady—and I am not\nin the least bit nervous.  I am a country girl by birth and upbringing, and the darkness means nothing to me.  It is the fog that\nworries me.  I stayed later than I should have done, and in my hurry to get back I lost my way.  Then I saw the light in your\nwindow and I came, meaning to ask where I was.  I had to climb p. 18over a wall, and in doing that I cut my arm on some glass.  I\nthink it is very stupid to put glass on walls—”\n\n“It shall be knocked off to-morrow,” I interrupted.\n\n“Oh, it doesn’t matter,” the girl said demurely.  “I am not likely to come this way again.  But do you know Cartordale?”\n\n“Well, know is hardly the word.  I am afraid I don’t very well.  I have only been here a short time,” I answered.  “I know very\nfew people.  I have never seen you before, for example.”\n\nThat was a leading question very thinly disguised, but she did not rise to it.\n\n“I am afraid,” I went on, “it would be but another instance of the blind leading the blind if I attempted to guide you about the\nDale.  I will do my best if you will tell me where you live, unless, indeed, you would prefer to stay here until morning.  The\nplace is at your service and I could very easily waken the—”\n\nBut my visitor’s negative gesture was very decided.\n\n“What house is this?” she demanded.\n\n“It is called Stone Hollow,” I told her.\n\n“Oh, I know Stone Hollow,” she cried.  “It was Mrs.—Mrs.—a lady with a curious name, but I have forgotten it.”\n\np. 19“Mrs. Mackaluce,” I volunteered.  “She was my aunt.”\n\n“Yes, that was the name, I remember now.  I have been here before, but never by the—the back window.  If you can put me on the\nroadway outside Stone Hollow I shall know where I am.”\n\n“I can take you home, at all events, if you can show me the way,” I said.\n\nThe girl looked at me for a moment or two doubtfully as if that were not quite what she had intended.\n\n“It is not right that you should be out alone at this time of the night,” I added.\n\n“Oh, right and wrong are merely terms,” she replied, rising to her feet.  “There is no law against being out at night.  It isn’t\nforbidden in the Defence of the Realm Act, is it?  If I like to be out at night it is right I should be.”\n\n“I was thinking of the danger, not of the law,” I responded dryly.\n\n“Why, whatever danger can there be?” the girl cried, opening wide her pretty eyes.  “There are no highway robbers in Cartordale,\nnor any Germans.”\n\nBut I did not argue with her.  I simply handed her the woollen cap which had fallen off when she fainted, then helped her to\nfasten the cloak p. 20around her, and finally led her into the hall, picking up my own hat and coat as I went.  I was fully\ndetermined on seeing her to her own home, wherever that might be and whatever her objections.  I opened the door noiselessly and\nclosed it again with the merest click of the lock.\n\n“It is very dark,” I muttered, being a man of the town and used to gas-lamps.\n\n“Yes, it often is at midnight,” the girl replied demurely, but with a little catch in her voice as if she were choking back a\nlaugh.  “But I can see very well.  Those who are country-born have eyes in their feet, you know, and never miss the path.  Why,\nthere are men of the Dale, and women too, for that matter, who will walk across the moors at dark and never miss the path for all\nit is no more than three feet wide.”\n\n“But you have lost your way once already to-night,” I murmured.\n\n“That doesn’t affect the question,” she retorted scornfully.  “It was only because I was trying a short cut.  I left the path of\nmy own accord.  If I had kept to the road I should have been home by now.  The longest way round is the quickest way home.  Is\nthat a proverb? It sounds like one.  If it isn’t it should be.  p. 21It is true, anyway.  Besides, it is foggy.  That makes a\ndifference.  Give me your hand.”\n\nApparently she did see better than I, for the next minute I felt the grip of her slender fingers as she seized mine and began to\npull me forward.  We went swiftly and in silence, still hand in hand, for some minutes, then her clasp loosened.\n\nFor a moment or two the shadow of her lingered beside me, then suddenly disappeared into the fog.  We had reached a part of the\nDale that was flanked on one side by a wall of rock which deepened even the blackness of the night and made the darkness, to me,\nat all events, absolutely impenetrable.  There was no sign of light or house, nor indeed of any building, and when I groped my way\nto the side of the road, I stumbled, first into a ditch and then against a low rubble wall, beyond which was only fog much thicker\nnow than it had been earlier in the evening.\n\nAnd it was there I lost her.  How she went, or in which direction, I had no idea.  But I had no doubt that she had evaded me of\ndesign—and that her home was nowhere thereabout.  That she knew the Dale intimately was evident.  She had deliberately led me to\nits darkest spot simply that she might there lose me.  I smiled grimly as I realised that.  She had fooled me p. 22with\nincomparable skill and wit.  I paid a frank mental tribute to her cleverness.  A young lady of brains, this, and one whose\nacquaintance was well worth cultivating.\n\nI stood waiting for some little time—possibly ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—then lit a cigarette and walked slowly back to\nStone Hollow, pondering over the queer little adventure, wondering who the girl was and whether—or rather when—I should see her\nagain.  She was evidently an inhabitant of the Dale—her familiarity with it at all events suggested that—in which case she could\nhardly expect to evade me permanently.  I must sooner or later meet and recognise her.  At any rate it was a piquant little\nmystery, and I must confess that somehow Cartordale no longer seemed quite so dull as it had been.\n\nI had little idea then as to what the mystery, in which I had thus become involved, really was or how quickly it would develop on\ntragic and very unexpected lines.\n\nI reached Stone Hollow again at 2.7 a.m.  The whole episode, from the knock on the window to my return home had occupied two hours\nfourteen minutes.",

I thought I would have made a good start with this book, but I have done next to nothing, and what there is of it is rotten.&nbsp; I could do more work in a week in London than I shall do in three months of this.&nbsp; I think I&rsquo;ll be getting back next week.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>But I was wrong in saying that nothing ever happened in Cartordale.&nbsp; Adventure was even at that moment coming towards me with very hurried footsteps.</p>\r\n<p>The time&mdash;it is essential always to be precise in details&mdash;was fifty-three minutes past eleven, and the date February 23rd.</p>\r\n<p>It came, the beginning of the story, with a quick, almost peremptory tapping on the window-pane and then the bottom sash was slowly pushed up.&nbsp; I turned to the desk and took a revolver from one of the small drawers, then strode across the room and raised the blind with a quick rattle, half expecting that my visitor would reveal himself in the shape of a burglar.&nbsp; What I saw brought even me to a standstill, little susceptible as I am to surprises of any sort.</p>\r\n<p>p. 15My visitor was not a burglar&mdash;at least, not a male of that species&mdash;but a girl, who looked young enough to be in her teens, though she may have been a year or two outside them, and a great deal too pretty to be wandering about alone at that time of night.&nbsp; She was wearing a long, sleeveless cloak and a grey, woollen cap, from beneath which part of her hair had escaped and was blowing about her face in little wisps of bronze-gold cloud.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Let me in,&rdquo; she whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Please&mdash;I have hurt myself and I am afraid to go on.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>I stretched out my hands and, placing them beneath her arms, lifted her over the low window-sill and into the room.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;How strong you are,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>\r\n<p>But even as she said that, the something that had kept her up gave way and she lay a limp, dead weight in my clasp.&nbsp; I carried her to the couch, but as I placed her down and began to unfasten the long, grey cloak, I noticed that the sleeve of her white blouse was stained with blood.&nbsp; That was evidently the hurt to which she had referred; and I began to wonder whether I had not better summon my housekeeper.&nbsp; It looked essentially a case for feminine aid.&nbsp; The girl, however, was already recovering.</p>\r\n<p>p. 16&ldquo;No, come here,&rdquo; she said, as I began to move towards the door.</p>\r\n<p>I returned to her side and gently lifted her arm.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, you have hurt yourself,&rdquo; I remarked.&nbsp; &ldquo;See&mdash;your arm, isn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;there is blood&mdash;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s my arm,&rdquo; she replied, lifting her cloak and showing a ragged tear in the blouse on the under-side of the sleeve.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not very bad&mdash;I think&mdash;but it seems to be bleeding a good deal, and I&mdash;I am afraid of blood.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;May I look at it?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could perhaps bandage it, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Are you a doctor&mdash;how nice!&rdquo; she cried.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied with a smile, &ldquo;I am not a doctor.&nbsp; But I am a first-aid expert, enough of one, anyway, to say whether or not a doctor is necessary.&nbsp; Yes, I have treated much bigger injuries than this.&nbsp; It is only a scratch, I fancy, and the blood looks more than it really is.&nbsp; A very little blood makes a mess of things.&nbsp; Lie still a minute.&nbsp; I have everything here within reach and we&rsquo;ll soon put you right.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>I brought a pair of scissors and cut away the sleeve, finding the arm beneath it&mdash;the left arm, by the way&mdash;rather badly gashed.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;To-morrow you must show that to a doctor,&rdquo; I said when I had washed and bandaged&nbsp;p. 17it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now I will give you a glass of wine and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Is there anyone but you in the house?&rdquo; the girl asked abruptly, as if some thought had suddenly occurred to her.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;There is my housekeeper,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and a maid.&nbsp; Shall I rouse them and&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Mercy, no!&rdquo; she exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whatever would they say if they found me here&mdash;at this time of night&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>I nodded, quite comprehending the hint so conveyed.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I have been visiting a friend,&rdquo; she went on, observing me keenly through her drooping eyelashes, perhaps to see how I took the story, &ldquo;and I&mdash;I lost my way.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Your friends should not have allowed you to attempt to find it by yourself,&rdquo; I returned.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;My friends are not plural,&rdquo; she retorted with a little trill of laughter.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&mdash;or rather she&mdash;she is a maiden lady&mdash;and I am not in the least bit nervous.&nbsp; I am a country girl by birth and upbringing, and the darkness means nothing to me.&nbsp; It is the fog that worries me.&nbsp; I stayed later than I should have done, and in my hurry to get back I lost my way.&nbsp; Then I saw the light in your window and I came, meaning to ask where I was.&nbsp; I had to climb&nbsp;p. 18over a wall, and in doing that I cut my arm on some glass.&nbsp; I think it is very stupid to put glass on walls&mdash;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It shall be knocked off to-morrow,&rdquo; I interrupted.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, it doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; the girl said demurely.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not likely to come this way again.&nbsp; But do you know Cartordale?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Well, know is hardly the word.&nbsp; I am afraid I don&rsquo;t very well.&nbsp; I have only been here a short time,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know very few people.&nbsp; I have never seen you before, for example.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>That was a leading question very thinly disguised, but she did not rise to it.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;it would be but another instance of the blind leading the blind if I attempted to guide you about the Dale.&nbsp; I will do my best if you will tell me where you live, unless, indeed, you would prefer to stay here until morning.&nbsp; The place is at your service and I could very easily waken the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>But my visitor&rsquo;s negative gesture was very decided.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;What house is this?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It is called Stone Hollow,&rdquo; I told her.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know Stone Hollow,&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was Mrs.&mdash;Mrs.&mdash;a lady with a curious name, but I have forgotten it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>p. 19&ldquo;Mrs. Mackaluce,&rdquo; I volunteered.&nbsp; &ldquo;She was my aunt.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, that was the name, I remember now.&nbsp; I have been here before, but never by the&mdash;the back window.&nbsp; If you can put me on the roadway outside Stone Hollow I shall know where I am.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I can take you home, at all events, if you can show me the way,&rdquo; I said.</p>\r\n<p>The girl looked at me for a moment or two doubtfully as if that were not quite what she had intended.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It is not right that you should be out alone at this time of the night,&rdquo; I added.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, right and wrong are merely terms,&rdquo; she replied, rising to her feet.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is no law against being out at night.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t forbidden in the Defence of the Realm Act, is it?&nbsp; If I like to be out at night it is right I should be.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of the danger, not of the law,&rdquo; I responded dryly.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Why, whatever danger can there be?&rdquo; the girl cried, opening wide her pretty eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are no highway robbers in Cartordale, nor any Germans.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>But I did not argue with her.&nbsp; I simply handed her the woollen cap which had fallen off when she fainted, then helped her to fasten the cloak&nbsp;p. 20around her, and finally led her into the hall, picking up my own hat and coat as I went.&nbsp; I was fully determined on seeing her to her own home, wherever that might be and whatever her objections.&nbsp; I opened the door noiselessly and closed it again with the merest click of the lock.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It is very dark,&rdquo; I muttered, being a man of the town and used to gas-lamps.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, it often is at midnight,&rdquo; the girl replied demurely, but with a little catch in her voice as if she were choking back a laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I can see very well.&nbsp; Those who are country-born have eyes in their feet, you know, and never miss the path.&nbsp; Why, there are men of the Dale, and women too, for that matter, who will walk across the moors at dark and never miss the path for all it is no more than three feet wide.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;But you have lost your way once already to-night,&rdquo; I murmured.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t affect the question,&rdquo; she retorted scornfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was only because I was trying a short cut.&nbsp; I left the path of my own accord.&nbsp; If I had kept to the road I should have been home by now.&nbsp; The longest way round is the quickest way home.&nbsp; Is that a proverb? It sounds like one.&nbsp; If it isn&rsquo;t it should be.&nbsp;&nbsp;p. 21It is true, anyway.&nbsp; Besides, it is foggy.&nbsp; That makes a difference.&nbsp; Give me your hand.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Apparently she did see better than I, for the next minute I felt the grip of her slender fingers as she seized mine and began to pull me forward.&nbsp; We went swiftly and in silence, still hand in hand, for some minutes, then her clasp loosened.</p>\r\n<p>For a moment or two the shadow of her lingered beside me, then suddenly disappeared into the fog.&nbsp; We had reached a part of the Dale that was flanked on one side by a wall of rock which deepened even the blackness of the night and made the darkness, to me, at all events, absolutely impenetrable.&nbsp; There was no sign of light or house, nor indeed of any building, and when I groped my way to the side of the road, I stumbled, first into a ditch and then against a low rubble wall, beyond which was only fog much thicker now than it had been earlier in the evening.</p>\r\n<p>And it was there I lost her.&nbsp; How she went, or in which direction, I had no idea.&nbsp; But I had no doubt that she had evaded me of design&mdash;and that her home was nowhere thereabout.&nbsp; That she knew the Dale intimately was evident.&nbsp; She had deliberately led me to its darkest spot simply that she might there lose me.&nbsp; I smiled grimly as I realised that.&nbsp; She had fooled me&nbsp;p. 22with incomparable skill and wit.&nbsp; I paid a frank mental tribute to her cleverness.&nbsp; A young lady of brains, this, and one whose acquaintance was well worth cultivating.</p>\r\n<p>I stood waiting for some little time&mdash;possibly ten minutes or a quarter of an hour&mdash;then lit a cigarette and walked slowly back to Stone Hollow, pondering over the queer little adventure, wondering who the girl was and whether&mdash;or rather when&mdash;I should see her again.&nbsp; She was evidently an inhabitant of the Dale&mdash;her familiarity with it at all events suggested that&mdash;in which case she could hardly expect to evade me permanently.&nbsp; I must sooner or later meet and recognise her.&nbsp; At any rate it was a piquant little mystery, and I must confess that somehow Cartordale no longer seemed quite so dull as it had been.</p>\r\n<p>I had little idea then as to what the mystery, in which I had thus become involved, really was or how quickly it would develop on tragic and very unexpected lines.</p>\r\n<p>I reached Stone Hollow again at 2.7 a.m.&nbsp; The whole episode, from the knock on the window to my return home had occupied two hours fourteen minutes.</p>",

  "shortDescription": "Riders to the Sea by J. M. Synge\r\n\r\nIt must have been on Synge’s second visit to the Aran Islands that he had the experience out of which was wrought what many believe to be his greatest play. The scene of “Riders to the Sea” is laid in a cottage on Inishmaan, the middle and most interesting island of the Aran group. While Synge was on Inishmaan, the story came to him of a man whose body had been washed up on the far away coast of Donegal, and who, by reason of certain peculiarities of dress, was suspected to be from the island. In due course, he was recognised as a native of Inishmaan, in exactly the manner described in the play, and perhaps one of the most poignantly vivid passages in Synge’s book on “The Aran Islands” relates the incident of his burial.",

Emma Vernon\r\nMEN AND WOMEN\r\n\n\n\nSCENE.\n\nAn Island off the West of Ireland.\n    (Cottage kitchen, with nets, oil-skins, spinning wheel, some new boards standing by the wall, etc. Cathleen, a girl of about\ntwenty, finishes kneading cake, and puts it down in the pot-oven by the fire; then wipes her hands, and begins to spin at the\nwheel. Nora, a young girl, puts her head in at the door.)\n\n\n\nNORA.\nIn a low voice.—Where is she?\n\nCATHLEEN.\nShe’s lying down, God help her, and may be sleeping, if she’s able.\n\n[Nora comes in softly, and takes a bundle from under her shawl.]\n\nCATHLEEN.\nSpinning the wheel rapidly.—What is it you have?\n\nNORA.\nThe young priest is after bringing them. It’s a shirt and a plain stocking were got off a drowned man in Donegal.\n\n[Cathleen stops her wheel with a sudden movement, and leans out to listen.]\n\nNORA.\nWe’re to find out if it’s Michael’s they are, some time herself will be down looking by the sea.\n\nCATHLEEN.\nHow would they be Michael’s, Nora. How would he go the length of that way to the far north?\n\nNORA.\nThe young priest says he’s known the like of it. “If it’s Michael’s they are,” says he, “you can tell herself he’s got a clean\nburial by the grace of God, and if they’re not his, let no one say a word about them, for she’ll be getting her death,” says he,\n“with crying and lamenting.”\n\n[The door which Nora half closed is blown open by a gust of wind.]\n\nCATHLEEN.\nLooking out anxiously.—Did you ask him would he stop Bartley going this day with the horses to the Galway fair?\n\nNORA.\n“I won’t stop him,” says he, “but let you not be afraid. Herself does be saying prayers half through the night, and the Almighty\nGod won’t leave her destitute,” says he, “with no son living.”\n\nCATHLEEN.\nIs the sea bad by the white rocks, Nora?\n\nNORA.\nMiddling bad, God help us. There’s a great roaring in the west, and it’s worse it’ll be getting when the tide’s turned to the\nwind.\n\n[She goes over to the table with the bundle.]\n\nShall I open it now?\n\nCATHLEEN.\nMaybe she’d wake up on us, and come in before we’d done.\n\n[Coming to the table.]\n\nIt’s a long time we’ll be, and the two of us crying.\n\nNORA.\nGoes to the inner door and listens.—She’s moving about on the bed. She’ll be coming in a minute.\n\nCATHLEEN.\nGive me the ladder, and I’ll put them up in the turf-loft, the way she won’t know of them at all, and maybe when the tide turns\nshe’ll be going down to see would he be floating from the east.\n\n[They put the ladder against the gable of the chimney; Cathleen goes up a few steps and hides the bundle in the turf-loft. Maurya\ncomes from the inner room.]\n\nMAURYA.\nLooking up at Cathleen and speaking querulously.—Isn’t it turf enough you have for this day and evening?\n\nCATHLEEN.\nThere’s a cake baking at the fire for a short space. [Throwing down the turf] and Bartley will want it when the tide turns if he\ngoes to Connemara.\n\n[Nora picks up the turf and puts it round the pot-oven.]\n\nMAURYA.\nSitting down on a stool at the fire.—He won’t go this day with the wind rising from the south and west. He won’t go this day, for\nthe young priest will stop him surely.\n\nNORA.\nHe’ll not stop him, mother, and I heard Eamon Simon and Stephen Pheety and Colum Shawn saying he would go.\n\nMAURYA.\nWhere is he itself?\n\nNORA.\nHe went down to see would there be another boat sailing in the week, and I’m thinking it won’t be long till he’s here now, for the\ntide’s turning at the green head, and the hooker’ tacking from the east.\n\nCATHLEEN.\nI hear some one passing the big stones.\n\nNORA.\nLooking out.—He’s coming now, and he’s in a hurry.\n\nBARTLEY.\nComes in and looks round the room. Speaking sadly and quietly.—Where is the bit of new rope, Cathleen, was bought in Connemara?\n\nCATHLEEN.\nComing down.—Give it to him, Nora; it’s on a nail by the white boards. I hung it up this morning, for the pig with the black feet\nwas eating it.\n\nNORA.\nGiving him a rope.—Is that it, Bartley?\n\nMAURYA.\nYou’d do right to leave that rope, Bartley, hanging by the boards [Bartley takes the rope]. It will be wanting in this place, I’m\ntelling you, if Michael is washed up to-morrow morning, or the next morning, or any morning in the week, for it’s a deep grave\nwe’ll make him by the grace of God.\n\nBARTLEY.\nBeginning to work with the rope.—I’ve no halter the way I can ride down on the mare, and I must go now quickly. This is the one\nboat going for two weeks or beyond it, and the fair will be a good fair for horses I heard them saying below.\n\nMAURYA.\nIt’s a hard thing they’ll be saying below if the body is washed up and there’s no man in it to make the coffin, and I after giving\na big price for the finest white boards you’d find in Connemara.\n\n[She looks round at the boards.]\n\nBARTLEY.\nHow would it be washed up, and we after looking each day for nine days, and a strong wind blowing a while back from the west and\nsouth?\n\nMAURYA.\nIf it wasn’t found itself, that wind is raising the sea, and there was a star up against the moon, and it rising in the night. If\nit was a hundred horses, or a thousand horses you had itself, what is the price of a thousand horses against a son where there is\none son only?\n\nBARTLEY.\nWorking at the halter, to Cathleen.—Let you go down each day, and see the sheep aren’t jumping in on the rye, and if the jobber\ncomes you can sell the pig with the black feet if there is a good price going.\n\nMAURYA.\nHow would the like of her get a good price for a pig?\n\nBARTLEY.\nTo Cathleen.—If the west wind holds with the last bit of the moon let you and Nora get up weed enough for another cock for the\nkelp. It’s hard set we’ll be from this day with no one in it but one man to work.\n\nMAURYA.\nIt’s hard set we’ll be surely the day you’re drownd’d with the rest. What way will I live and the girls with me, and I an old\nwoman looking for the grave?\n\n[Bartley lays down the halter, takes off his old coat, and puts on a newer one of the same flannel.]\n\nBARTLEY.\nTo Nora.—Is she coming to the pier?\n\nNORA.\nLooking out.—She’s passing the green head and letting fall her sails.\n\nBARTLEY.\nGetting his purse and tobacco.—I’ll have half an hour to go down, and you’ll see me coming again in two days, or in three days, or\nmaybe in four days if the wind is bad.\n\nMAURYA.\nTurning round to the fire, and putting her shawl over her head.—Isn’t it a hard and cruel man won’t hear a word from an old woman,\nand she holding him from the sea?\n\nCATHLEEN.\nIt’s the life of a young man to be going on the sea, and who would listen to an old woman with one thing and she saying it over?\n\nBARTLEY.\nTaking the halter.—I must go now quickly. I’ll ride down on the red mare, and the gray pony’ll run behind me. . . The blessing of\nGod on you.\n\n[He goes out.]\n\nMAURYA.\nCrying out as he is in the door.—He’s gone now, God spare us, and we’ll not see him again. He’s gone now, and when the black night\nis falling I’ll have no son left me in the world.\n\nCATHLEEN.\nWhy wouldn’t you give him your blessing and he looking round in the door? Isn’t it sorrow enough is on every one in this house\nwithout your sending him out with an unlucky word behind him, and a hard word in his ear?\n\n[Maurya takes up the tongs and begins raking the fire aimlessly without looking round.]\n\nNORA.\nTurning towards her.—You’re taking away the turf from the cake.\n\nCATHLEEN.\nCrying out.—The Son of God forgive us, Nora, we’re after forgetting his bit of bread.\n\n[She comes over to the fire.]\n\nNORA.\nAnd it’s destroyed he’ll be going till dark night, and he after eating nothing since the sun went up.\n\nCATHLEEN.\nTurning the cake out of the oven.—It’s destroyed he’ll be, surely. There’s no sense left on any person in a house where an old\nwoman will be talking for ever.\n\n[Maurya sways herself on her stool.]\n\nCATHLEEN.\nCutting off some of the bread and rolling it in a cloth; to Maurya.—Let you go down now to the spring well and give him this and\nhe passing. You’ll see him then and the dark word will be broken, and you can say “God speed you,” the way he’ll be easy in his\nmind.\n\nMAURYA.\nTaking the bread.—Will I be in it as soon as himself?\n\nCATHLEEN.\nIf you go now quickly.\n\nMAURYA.\nStanding up unsteadily.—It’s hard set I am to walk.\n\nCATHLEEN.\nLooking at her anxiously.—Give her the stick, Nora, or maybe she’ll slip on the big stones.\n\nNORA.\nWhat stick?\n\nCATHLEEN.\nThe stick Michael brought from Connemara.\n\nMAURYA.\nTaking a stick Nora gives her.—In the big world the old people do be leaving things after them for their sons and children, but in\nthis place it is the young men do be leaving things behind for them that do be old.\n\n[She goes out slowly. Nora goes over to the ladder.]\n\nCATHLEEN.\nWait, Nora, maybe she’d turn back quickly. She’s that sorry, God help her, you wouldn’t know the thing she’d do.\n\nNORA.\nIs she gone round by the bush?\n\nCATHLEEN.\nLooking out.—She’s gone now. Throw it down quickly, for the Lord knows when she’ll be out of it again.\n\nNORA.\nGetting the bundle from the loft.—The young priest said he’d be passing to-morrow, and we might go down and speak to him below if\nit’s Michael’s they are surely.\n\nCATHLEEN.\nTaking the bundle.—Did he say what way they were found?\n\nNORA.\nComing down.—“There were two men,” says he, “and they rowing round with poteen before the cocks crowed, and the oar of one of them\ncaught the body, and they passing the black cliffs of the north.”\n\nCATHLEEN.\nTrying to open the bundle.—Give me a knife, Nora, the string’s perished with the salt water, and there’s a black knot on it you\nwouldn’t loosen in a week.\n\nNORA.\nGiving her a knife.—I’ve heard tell it was a long way to Donegal.\n\nCATHLEEN.\nCutting the string.—It is surely. There was a man in here a while ago—the man sold us that knife—and he said if you set off\nwalking from the rocks beyond, it would be seven days you’d be in Donegal.\n\nNORA.\nAnd what time would a man take, and he floating?\n\n[Cathleen opens the bundle and takes out a bit of a stocking. They look at them eagerly.]\n\nCATHLEEN.\nIn a low voice.—The Lord spare us, Nora! isn’t it a queer hard thing to say if it’s his they are surely?\n\nNORA.\nI’ll get his shirt off the hook the way we can put the one flannel on the other [she looks through some clothes hanging in the\ncorner.] It’s not with them, Cathleen, and where will it be?\n\nCATHLEEN.\nI’m thinking Bartley put it on him in the morning, for his own shirt was heavy with the salt in it [pointing to the corner].\nThere’s a bit of a sleeve was of the same stuff. Give me that and it will do.\n\n[Nora brings it to her and they compare the flannel.]\n\nCATHLEEN.\nIt’s the same stuff, Nora; but if it is itself aren’t there great rolls of it in the shops of Galway, and isn’t it many another\nman may have a shirt of it as well as Michael himself?\n\nNORA.\nWho has taken up the stocking and counted the stitches, crying out.—It’s Michael, Cathleen, it’s Michael; God spare his soul, and\nwhat will herself say when she hears this story, and Bartley on the sea?\n\nCATHLEEN.\nTaking the stocking.—It’s a plain stocking.\n\nNORA.\nIt’s the second one of the third pair I knitted, and I put up three score stitches, and I dropped four of them.\n\nCATHLEEN.\nCounts the stitches.—It’s that number is in it [crying out.] Ah, Nora, isn’t it a bitter thing to think of him floating that way\nto the far north, and no one to keen him but the black hags that do be flying on the sea?\n\nNORA.\nSwinging herself round, and throwing out her arms on the clothes.—And isn’t it a pitiful thing when there is nothing left of a man\nwho was a great rower and fisher, but a bit of an old shirt and a plain stocking?\n\nCATHLEEN.\nAfter an instant.—Tell me is herself coming, Nora? I hear a little sound on the path.\n\nNORA.\nLooking out.—She is, Cathleen. She’s coming up to the door.\n\nCATHLEEN.\nPut these things away before she’ll come in. Maybe it’s easier she’ll be after giving her blessing to Bartley, and we won’t let on\nwe’ve heard anything the time he’s on the sea.\n\nNORA.\nHelping Cathleen to close the bundle.—We’ll put them here in the corner.\n\n[They put them into a hole in the chimney corner. Cathleen goes back to the spinning-wheel.]",

It&rsquo;s a shirt and a plain stocking were got off a drowned man in Donegal.</p>\r\n<p>[<em>Cathleen stops her wheel with a sudden movement, and leans out to listen.</em>]</p>\r\n<p>NORA.<br>We&rsquo;re to find out if it&rsquo;s Michael&rsquo;s they are, some time herself will be down looking by the sea.</p>\r\n<p>CATHLEEN.<br>How would they be Michael&rsquo;s, Nora. How would he go the length of that way to the far north?</p>\r\n<p>NORA.<br>The young priest says he&rsquo;s known the like of it. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s Michael&rsquo;s they are,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;you can tell herself he&rsquo;s got a clean burial by the grace of God, and if they&rsquo;re not his, let no one say a word about them, for she&rsquo;ll be getting her death,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;with crying and lamenting.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>[<em>The door which Nora half closed is blown open by a gust of wind.</em>]</p>\r\n<p>CATHLEEN.<br><em>Looking out anxiously.</em>&mdash;Did you ask him would he stop Bartley going this day with the horses to the Galway fair?</p>\r\n<p>NORA.<br>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stop him,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;but let you not be afraid. Herself does be saying prayers half through the night, and the Almighty God won&rsquo;t leave her destitute,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;with no son living.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>CATHLEEN.<br>Is the sea bad by the white rocks, Nora?</p>\r\n<p>NORA.<br>Middling bad, God help us. There&rsquo;s a great roaring in the west, and it&rsquo;s worse it&rsquo;ll be getting when the tide&rsquo;s turned to the wind.</p>\r\n<p>[<em>She goes over to the table with the bundle.</em>]</p>\r\n<p>Shall I open it now?</p>\r\n<p>CATHLEEN.<br>Maybe she&rsquo;d wake up on us, and come in before we&rsquo;d done.</p>\r\n<p>[<em>Coming to the table.</em>]</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a long time we&rsquo;ll be, and the two of us crying.</p>\r\n<p>NORA.<br><em>Goes to the inner door and listens.</em>&mdash;She&rsquo;s moving about on the bed. She&rsquo;ll be coming in a minute.</p>\r\n<p>CATHLEEN.<br>Give me the ladder, and I&rsquo;ll put them up in the turf-loft, the way she won&rsquo;t know of them at all, and maybe when the tide turns she&rsquo;ll be going down to see would he be floating from the east.</p>\r\n<p>[<em>They put the ladder against the gable of the chimney; Cathleen goes up a few steps and hides the bundle in the turf-loft. Maurya comes from the inner room.</em>]</p>\r\n<p>MAURYA.<br><em>Looking up at Cathleen and speaking querulously.</em>&mdash;Isn&rsquo;t it turf enough you have for this day and evening?</p>\r\n<p>CATHLEEN.<br>There&rsquo;s a cake baking at the fire for a short space. [<em>Throwing down the turf</em>] and Bartley will want it when the tide turns if he goes to Connemara.</p>\r\n<p>[<em>Nora picks up the turf and puts it round the pot-oven.</em>]</p>\r\n<p>MAURYA.<br><em>Sitting down on a stool at the fire.</em>&mdash;He won&rsquo;t go this day with the wind rising from the south and west. He won&rsquo;t go this day, for the young priest will stop him surely.</p>\r\n<p>NORA.<br>He&rsquo;ll not stop him, mother, and I heard Eamon Simon and Stephen Pheety and Colum Shawn saying he would go.</p>\r\n<p>MAURYA.<br>Where is he itself?</p>\r\n<p>NORA.<br>He went down to see would there be another boat sailing in the week, and I&rsquo;m thinking it won&rsquo;t be long till he&rsquo;s here now, for the tide&rsquo;s turning at the green head, and the hooker&rsquo; tacking from the east.</p>\r\n<p>CATHLEEN.<br>I hear some one passing the big stones.</p>\r\n<p>NORA.<br><em>Looking out.</em>&mdash;He&rsquo;s coming now, and he&rsquo;s in a hurry.</p>\r\n<p>BARTLEY.<br><em>Comes in and looks round the room. Speaking sadly and quietly.</em>&mdash;Where is the bit of new rope, Cathleen, was bought in Connemara?</p>\r\n<p>CATHLEEN.<br><em>Coming down.</em>&mdash;Give it to him, Nora; it&rsquo;s on a nail by the white boards. I hung it up this morning, for the pig with the black feet was eating it.</p>\r\n<p>NORA.<br><em>Giving him a rope.</em>&mdash;Is that it, Bartley?</p>\r\n<p>MAURYA.<br>You&rsquo;d do right to leave that rope, Bartley, hanging by the boards [<em>Bartley takes the rope</em>]. It will be wanting in this place, I&rsquo;m telling you, if Michael is washed up to-morrow morning, or the next morning, or any morning in the week, for it&rsquo;s a deep grave we&rsquo;ll make him by the grace of God.</p>\r\n<p>BARTLEY.<br><em>Beginning to work with the rope.</em>&mdash;I&rsquo;ve no halter the way I can ride down on the mare, and I must go now quickly. This is the one boat going for two weeks or beyond it, and the fair will be a good fair for horses I heard them saying below.</p>\r\n<p>MAURYA.<br>It&rsquo;s a hard thing they&rsquo;ll be saying below if the body is washed up and there&rsquo;s no man in it to make the coffin, and I after giving a big price for the finest white boards you&rsquo;d find in Connemara.</p>\r\n<p>[<em>She looks round at the boards.</em>]</p>\r\n<p>BARTLEY.<br>How would it be washed up, and we after looking each day for nine days, and a strong wind blowing a while back from the west and south?</p>\r\n<p>MAURYA.<br>If it wasn&rsquo;t found itself, that wind is raising the sea, and there was a star up against the moon, and it rising in the night. If it was a hundred horses, or a thousand horses you had itself, what is the price of a thousand horses against a son where there is one son only?</p>\r\n<p>BARTLEY.<br><em>Working at the halter, to Cathleen.</em>&mdash;Let you go down each day, and see the sheep aren&rsquo;t jumping in on the rye, and if the jobber comes you can sell the pig with the black feet if there is a good price going.</p>\r\n<p>MAURYA.<br>How would the like of her get a good price for a pig?</p>\r\n<p>BARTLEY.<br><em>To Cathleen.</em>&mdash;If the west wind holds with the last bit of the moon let you and Nora get up weed enough for another cock for the kelp. It&rsquo;s hard set we&rsquo;ll be from this day with no one in it but one man to work.</p>\r\n<p>MAURYA.<br>It&rsquo;s hard set we&rsquo;ll be surely the day you&rsquo;re drownd&rsquo;d with the rest. What way will I live and the girls with me, and I an old woman looking for the grave?</p>\r\n<p>[<em>Bartley lays down the halter, takes off his old coat, and puts on a newer one of the same flannel.</em>]</p>\r\n<p>BARTLEY.<br><em>To Nora.</em>&mdash;Is she coming to the pier?</p>\r\n<p>NORA.<br><em>Looking out.</em>&mdash;She&rsquo;s passing the green head and letting fall her sails.</p>\r\n<p>BARTLEY.<br><em>Getting his purse and tobacco.</em>&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have half an hour to go down, and you&rsquo;ll see me coming again in two days, or in three days, or maybe in four days if the wind is bad.</p>\r\n<p>MAURYA.<br><em>Turning round to the fire, and putting her shawl over her head.</em>&mdash;Isn&rsquo;t it a hard and cruel man won&rsquo;t hear a word from an old woman, and she holding him from the sea?</p>\r\n<p>CATHLEEN.<br>It&rsquo;s the life of a young man to be going on the sea, and who would listen to an old woman with one thing and she saying it over?</p>\r\n<p>BARTLEY.<br><em>Taking the halter.</em>&mdash;I must go now quickly. I&rsquo;ll ride down on the red mare, and the gray pony&rsquo;ll run behind me. . . The blessing of God on you.</p>\r\n<p>[<em>He goes out.</em>]</p>\r\n<p>MAURYA.<br><em>Crying out as he is in the door.</em>&mdash;He&rsquo;s gone now, God spare us, and we&rsquo;ll not see him again. He&rsquo;s gone now, and when the black night is falling I&rsquo;ll have no son left me in the world.</p>\r\n<p>CATHLEEN.<br>Why wouldn&rsquo;t you give him your blessing and he looking round in the door? Isn&rsquo;t it sorrow enough is on every one in this house without your sending him out with an unlucky word behind him, and a hard word in his ear?</p>\r\n<p>[<em>Maurya takes up the tongs and begins raking the fire aimlessly without looking round.</em>]</p>\r\n<p>NORA.<br><em>Turning towards her.</em>&mdash;You&rsquo;re taking away the turf from the cake.</p>\r\n<p>CATHLEEN.<br><em>Crying out.</em>&mdash;The Son of God forgive us, Nora, we&rsquo;re after forgetting his bit of bread.</p>\r\n<p>[<em>She comes over to the fire.</em>]</p>\r\n<p>NORA.<br>And it&rsquo;s destroyed he&rsquo;ll be going till dark night, and he after eating nothing since the sun went up.</p>\r\n<p>CATHLEEN.<br><em>Turning the cake out of the oven.</em>&mdash;It&rsquo;s destroyed he&rsquo;ll be, surely. There&rsquo;s no sense left on any person in a house where an old woman will be talking for ever.</p>\r\n<p>[<em>Maurya sways herself on her stool.</em>]</p>\r\n<p>CATHLEEN.<br><em>Cutting off some of the bread and rolling it in a cloth; to Maurya.</em>&mdash;Let you go down now to the spring well and give him this and he passing. You&rsquo;ll see him then and the dark word will be broken, and you can say &ldquo;God speed you,&rdquo; the way he&rsquo;ll be easy in his mind.</p>\r\n<p>MAURYA.<br><em>Taking the bread.</em>&mdash;Will I be in it as soon as himself?</p>\r\n<p>CATHLEEN.<br>If you go now quickly.</p>\r\n<p>MAURYA.<br><em>Standing up unsteadily.</em>&mdash;It&rsquo;s hard set I am to walk.</p>\r\n<p>CATHLEEN.<br><em>Looking at her anxiously.</em>&mdash;Give her the stick, Nora, or maybe she&rsquo;ll slip on the big stones.</p>\r\n<p>NORA.<br>What stick?</p>\r\n<p>CATHLEEN.<br>The stick Michael brought from Connemara.</p>\r\n<p>MAURYA.<br><em>Taking a stick Nora gives her.</em>&mdash;In the big world the old people do be leaving things after them for their sons and children, but in this place it is the young men do be leaving things behind for them that do be old.</p>\r\n<p>[<em>She goes out slowly. Nora goes over to the ladder.</em>]</p>\r\n<p>CATHLEEN.<br>Wait, Nora, maybe she&rsquo;d turn back quickly. She&rsquo;s that sorry, God help her, you wouldn&rsquo;t know the thing she&rsquo;d do.</p>\r\n<p>NORA.<br>Is she gone round by the bush?</p>\r\n<p>CATHLEEN.<br><em>Looking out.</em>&mdash;She&rsquo;s gone now. Throw it down quickly, for the Lord knows when she&rsquo;ll be out of it again.</p>\r\n<p>NORA.<br><em>Getting the bundle from the loft.</em>&mdash;The young priest said he&rsquo;d be passing to-morrow, and we might go down and speak to him below if it&rsquo;s Michael&rsquo;s they are surely.</p>\r\n<p>CATHLEEN.<br><em>Taking the bundle.</em>&mdash;Did he say what way they were found?</p>\r\n<p>NORA.<br><em>Coming down.</em>&mdash;&ldquo;There were two men,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and they rowing round with poteen before the cocks crowed, and the oar of one of them caught the body, and they passing the black cliffs of the north.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>CATHLEEN.<br><em>Trying to open the bundle.</em>&mdash;Give me a knife, Nora, the string&rsquo;s perished with the salt water, and there&rsquo;s a black knot on it you wouldn&rsquo;t loosen in a week.</p>\r\n<p>NORA.<br><em>Giving her a knife.</em>&mdash;I&rsquo;ve heard tell it was a long way to Donegal.</p>\r\n<p>CATHLEEN.<br><em>Cutting the string.</em>&mdash;It is surely. There was a man in here a while ago&mdash;the man sold us that knife&mdash;and he said if you set off walking from the rocks beyond, it would be seven days you&rsquo;d be in Donegal.</p>\r\n<p>NORA.<br>And what time would a man take, and he floating?</p>\r\n<p>[<em>Cathleen opens the bundle and takes out a bit of a stocking. They look at them eagerly.</em>]</p>\r\n<p>CATHLEEN.<br><em>In a low voice.</em>&mdash;The Lord spare us, Nora! isn&rsquo;t it a queer hard thing to say if it&rsquo;s his they are surely?</p>\r\n<p>NORA.<br>I&rsquo;ll get his shirt off the hook the way we can put the one flannel on the other [<em>she looks through some clothes hanging in the corner.</em>] It&rsquo;s not with them, Cathleen, and where will it be?</p>\r\n<p>CATHLEEN.<br>I&rsquo;m thinking Bartley put it on him in the morning, for his own shirt was heavy with the salt in it [<em>pointing to the corner</em>]. There&rsquo;s a bit of a sleeve was of the same stuff. Give me that and it will do.</p>\r\n<p>[<em>Nora brings it to her and they compare the flannel.</em>]</p>\r\n<p>CATHLEEN.<br>It&rsquo;s the same stuff, Nora; but if it is itself aren&rsquo;t there great rolls of it in the shops of Galway, and isn&rsquo;t it many another man may have a shirt of it as well as Michael himself?</p>\r\n<p>NORA.<br><em>Who has taken up the stocking and counted the stitches, crying out.</em>&mdash;It&rsquo;s Michael, Cathleen, it&rsquo;s Michael; God spare his soul, and what will herself say when she hears this story, and Bartley on the sea?</p>\r\n<p>CATHLEEN.<br><em>Taking the stocking.</em>&mdash;It&rsquo;s a plain stocking.</p>\r\n<p>NORA.<br>It&rsquo;s the second one of the third pair I knitted, and I put up three score stitches, and I dropped four of them.</p>\r\n<p>CATHLEEN.<br><em>Counts the stitches.</em>&mdash;It&rsquo;s that number is in it [<em>crying out.</em>] Ah, Nora, isn&rsquo;t it a bitter thing to think of him floating that way to the far north, and no one to keen him but the black hags that do be flying on the sea?</p>\r\n<p>NORA.<br><em>Swinging herself round, and throwing out her arms on the clothes.</em>&mdash;And isn&rsquo;t it a pitiful thing when there is nothing left of a man who was a great rower and fisher, but a bit of an old shirt and a plain stocking?</p>\r\n<p>CATHLEEN.<br><em>After an instant.</em>&mdash;Tell me is herself coming, Nora? I hear a little sound on the path.</p>\r\n<p>NORA.<br><em>Looking out.</em>&mdash;She is, Cathleen. She&rsquo;s coming up to the door.</p>\r\n<p>CATHLEEN.<br>Put these things away before she&rsquo;ll come in.

  "contentText": "CHAPTER I\n\n“Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the Buonapartes. But I warn you, if you don’t tell me that this\nmeans war, if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that Antichrist—I really believe he is Antichrist—I\nwill have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my ‘faithful slave,’ as you call yourself! But\nhow do you do? I see I have frightened you—sit down and tell me all the news.”\n\nIt was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pávlovna Schérer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Márya\nFëdorovna. With these words she greeted Prince Vasíli Kurágin, a man of high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at\nher reception. Anna Pávlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a\nnew word in St. Petersburg, used only by the elite.\n\nAll her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as\nfollows:\n\n“If you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too\nterrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10—Annette Schérer.”\n\n“Heavens! what a virulent attack!” replied the prince, not in the least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered,\nwearing an embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat\nface. He spoke in that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and with the gentle, patronizing\nintonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna Pávlovna, kissed her hand,\npresenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head, and complacently seated himself on the sofa.\n\n“First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend’s mind at rest,” said he without altering his tone, beneath the\npoliteness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned.\n\n“Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like these if one has any feeling?” said Anna Pávlovna. “You\nare staying the whole evening, I hope?”\n\n“And the fete at the English ambassador’s? Today is Wednesday. I must put in an appearance there,” said the prince. “My daughter\nis coming for me to take me there.”\n\n“I thought today’s fete had been canceled. I confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.”\n\n“If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been put off,” said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by\nforce of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.\n\n“Don’t tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosíltsev’s dispatch? You know everything.”\n\n“What can one say about it?” replied the prince in a cold, listless tone. “What has been decided? They have decided that\nBuonaparte has burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.”\n\nPrince Vasíli always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale part. Anna Pávlovna Schérer on the contrary, despite her\nforty years, overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and, sometimes even\nwhen she did not feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her. The\nsubdued smile which, though it did not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed, as in a spoiled child, a\ncontinual consciousness of her charming defect, which she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to correct.\n\nIn the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pávlovna burst out:\n\n“Oh, don’t speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I don’t understand things, but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war.\nShe is betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracious sovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it.\nThat is the one thing I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform the noblest role on earth, and he is so\nvirtuous and noble that God will not forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of revolution, which has become\nmore terrible than ever in the person of this murderer and villain! We alone must avenge the blood of the just one.... Whom, I ask\nyou, can we rely on?... England with her commercial spirit will not and cannot understand the Emperor Alexander’s loftiness of\nsoul. She has refused to evacuate Malta. She wanted to find, and still seeks, some secret motive in our actions. What answer did\nNovosíltsev get? None. The English have not understood and cannot understand the self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing\nfor himself, but only desires the good of mankind. And what have they promised? Nothing! And what little they have promised they\nwill not perform! Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and that all Europe is powerless before him.... And I\ndon’t believe a word that Hardenburg says, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian neutrality is just a trap. I have faith only\nin God and the lofty destiny of our adored monarch. He will save Europe!”\n\nShe suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity.\n\n“I think,” said the prince with a smile, “that if you had been sent instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the\nKing of Prussia’s consent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will you give me a cup of tea?”\n\n“In a moment. À propos,” she added, becoming calm again, “I am expecting two very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de\nMortemart, who is connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of the best French families. He is one of the\ngenuine émigrés, the good ones. And also the Abbé Morio. Do you know that profound thinker? He has been received by the Emperor.\nHad you heard?”\n\n“I shall be delighted to meet them,” said the prince. “But tell me,” he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just\noccurred to him, though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his visit, “is it true that the Dowager Empress\nwants Baron Funke to be appointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all accounts is a poor creature.”\n\nPrince Vasíli wished to obtain this post for his son, but others were trying through the Dowager Empress Márya Fëdorovna to secure\nit for the baron.\n\nAnna Pávlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor anyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress\ndesired or was pleased with.\n\n“Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her sister,” was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone.\n\nAs she named the Empress, Anna Pávlovna’s face suddenly assumed an expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled\nwith sadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious patroness. She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show\nBaron Funke beaucoup d’estime, and again her face clouded over with sadness.\n\nThe prince was silent and looked indifferent. But, with the womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, Anna\nPávlovna wished both to rebuke him (for daring to speak as he had done of a man recommended to the Empress) and at the same time\nto console him, so she said:\n\n“Now about your family. Do you know that since your daughter came out everyone has been enraptured by her? They say she is\namazingly beautiful.”\n\nThe prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude.\n\n“I often think,” she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that\npolitical and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate conversation—“I often think how unfairly sometimes the\njoys of life are distributed. Why has fate given you two such splendid children? I don’t speak of Anatole, your youngest. I don’t\nlike him,” she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows. “Two such charming children. And really you\nappreciate them less than anyone, and so you don’t deserve to have them.”\n\nAnd she smiled her ecstatic smile.\n\n“I can’t help it,” said the prince. “Lavater would have said I lack the bump of paternity.”\n\n“Don’t joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you know I am dissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselves” (and\nher face assumed its melancholy expression), “he was mentioned at Her Majesty’s and you were pitied....”\n\nThe prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly, awaiting a reply. He frowned.\n\n“What would you have me do?” he said at last. “You know I did all a father could for their education, and they have both turned\nout fools. Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active one. That is the only difference between them.” He said\nthis smiling in a way more natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles round his mouth very clearly revealed something\nunexpectedly coarse and unpleasant.\n\n“And why are children born to such men as you? If you were not a father there would be nothing I could reproach you with,” said\nAnna Pávlovna, looking up pensively.\n\n“I am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my children are the bane of my life. It is the cross I have to bear.\nThat is how I explain it to myself. It can’t be helped!”\n\nHe said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a gesture. Anna Pávlovna meditated.\n\n“Have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole?” she asked. “They say old maids have a mania for matchmaking, and\nthough I don’t feel that weakness in myself as yet, I know a little person who is very unhappy with her father. She is a relation\nof yours, Princess Mary Bolkónskaya.”\n\nPrince Vasíli did not reply, though, with the quickness of memory and perception befitting a man of the world, he indicated by a\nmovement of the head that he was considering this information.\n\n“Do you know,” he said at last, evidently unable to check the sad current of his thoughts, “that Anatole is costing me forty\nthousand rubles a year? And,” he went on after a pause, “what will it be in five years, if he goes on like this?” Presently he\nadded: “That’s what we fathers have to put up with.... Is this princess of yours rich?”\n\n“Her father is very rich and stingy. He lives in the country. He is the well-known Prince Bolkónski who had to retire from the\narmy under the late Emperor, and was nicknamed ‘the King of Prussia.’ He is very clever but eccentric, and a bore. The poor girl\nis very unhappy. She has a brother; I think you know him, he married Lise Meinen lately. He is an aide-de-camp of Kutúzov’s and\nwill be here tonight.”\n\n“Listen, dear Annette,” said the prince, suddenly taking Anna Pávlovna’s hand and for some reason drawing it downwards. “Arrange\nthat affair for me and I shall always be your most devoted slave-slafe with an f, as a village elder of mine writes in his\nreports. She is rich and of good family and that’s all I want.”\n\nAnd with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him, he raised the maid of honor’s hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it\nto and fro as he lay back in his armchair, looking in another direction.\n\n“Attendez,” said Anna Pávlovna, reflecting, “I’ll speak to Lise, young Bolkónski’s wife, this very evening, and perhaps the thing\ncan be arranged. It shall be on your family’s behalf that I’ll start my apprenticeship as old maid.”\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nAnna Pávlovna’s drawing room was gradually filling. The highest Petersburg society was assembled there: people differing widely in\nage and character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged. Prince Vasíli’s daughter, the beautiful Hélène, came to\ntake her father to the ambassador’s entertainment; she wore a ball dress and her badge as maid of honor. The youthful little\nPrincess Bolkónskaya, known as la femme la plus séduisante de Pétersbourg, * was also there. She had been married during the\nprevious winter, and being pregnant did not go to any large gatherings, but only to small receptions. Prince Vasíli’s son,\nHippolyte, had come with Mortemart, whom he introduced. The Abbé Morio and many others had also come.\n\n* The most fascinating woman in Petersburg.\n\nTo each new arrival Anna Pávlovna said, “You have not yet seen my aunt,” or “You do not know my aunt?” and very gravely conducted\nhim or her to a little old lady, wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap, who had come sailing in from another room as soon as the\nguests began to arrive; and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt, Anna Pávlovna mentioned each one’s name and then\nleft them.\n\nEach visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not one of them knew, not one of them wanted to know, and not\none of them cared about; Anna Pávlovna observed these greetings with mournful and solemn interest and silent approval. The aunt\nspoke to each of them in the same words, about their health and her own, and the health of Her Majesty, “who, thank God, was\nbetter today.” And each visitor, though politeness prevented his showing impatience, left the old woman with a sense of relief at\nhaving performed a vexatious duty and did not return to her the whole evening.\n\nThe young Princess Bolkónskaya had brought some work in a gold-embroidered velvet bag. Her pretty little upper lip, on which a\ndelicate dark down was just perceptible, was too short for her teeth, but it lifted all the more sweetly, and was especially\ncharming when she occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip. As is always the case with a thoroughly attractive woman, her\ndefect—the shortness of her upper lip and her half-open mouth—seemed to be her own special and peculiar form of beauty. Everyone\nbrightened at the sight of this pretty young woman, so soon to become a mother, so full of life and health, and carrying her\nburden so lightly. Old men and dull dispirited young ones who looked at her, after being in her company and talking to her a\nlittle while, felt as if they too were becoming, like her, full of life and health. All who talked to her, and at each word saw\nher bright smile and the constant gleam of her white teeth, thought that they were in a specially amiable mood that day.\n\nThe little princess went round the table with quick, short, swaying steps, her workbag on her arm, and gaily spreading out her\ndress sat down on a sofa near the silver samovar, as if all she was doing was a pleasure to herself and to all around her. “I have\nbrought my work,” said she in French, displaying her bag and addressing all present. “Mind, Annette, I hope you have not played a\nwicked trick on me,” she added, turning to her hostess. “You wrote that it was to be quite a small reception, and just see how\nbadly I am dressed.” And she spread out her arms to show her short-waisted, lace-trimmed, dainty gray dress, girdled with a broad\nribbon just below the breast.\n\n“Soyez tranquille, Lise, you will always be prettier than anyone else,” replied Anna Pávlovna.\n\n“You know,” said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in French, turning to a general, “my husband is deserting me? He\nis going to get himself killed. Tell me what this wretched war is for?” she added, addressing Prince Vasíli, and without waiting\nfor an answer she turned to speak to his daughter, the beautiful Hélène.\n\n“What a delightful woman this little princess is!” said Prince Vasíli to Anna Pávlovna.\n\nOne of the next arrivals was a stout, heavily built young man with close-cropped hair, spectacles, the light-colored breeches\nfashionable at that time, a very high ruffle, and a brown dress coat. This stout young man was an illegitimate son of Count\nBezúkhov, a well-known grandee of Catherine’s time who now lay dying in Moscow. The young man had not yet entered either the\nmilitary or civil service, as he had only just returned from abroad where he had been educated, and this was his first appearance\nin society. Anna Pávlovna greeted him with the nod she accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room. But in spite of this\nlowest-grade greeting, a look of anxiety and fear, as at the sight of something too large and unsuited to the place, came over her\nface when she saw Pierre enter. Though he was certainly rather bigger than the other men in the room, her anxiety could only have\nreference to the clever though shy, but observant and natural, expression which distinguished him from everyone else in that\ndrawing room.\n\n“It is very good of you, Monsieur Pierre, to come and visit a poor invalid,” said Anna Pávlovna, exchanging an alarmed glance with\nher aunt as she conducted him to her.\n\nPierre murmured something unintelligible, and continued to look round as if in search of something. On his way to the aunt he\nbowed to the little princess with a pleased smile, as to an intimate acquaintance.\n\nAnna Pávlovna’s alarm was justified, for Pierre turned away from the aunt without waiting to hear her speech about Her Majesty’s\nhealth. Anna Pávlovna in dismay detained him with the words: “Do you know the Abbé Morio? He is a most interesting man.”\n\n“Yes, I have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace, and it is very interesting but hardly feasible.”\n\n“You think so?” rejoined Anna Pávlovna in order to say something and get away to attend to her duties as hostess. But Pierre now\ncommitted a reverse act of impoliteness. First he had left a lady before she had finished speaking to him, and now he continued to\nspeak to another who wished to get away. With his head bent, and his big feet spread apart, he began explaining his reasons for\nthinking the abbé’s plan chimerical.\n\n“We will talk of it later,” said Anna Pávlovna with a smile.\n\nAnd having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave, she resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and\nwatch, ready to help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag. As the foreman of a spinning mill, when he has set\nthe hands to work, goes round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that creaks or makes more noise than it\nshould, and hastens to check the machine or set it in proper motion, so Anna Pávlovna moved about her drawing room, approaching\nnow a silent, now a too-noisy group, and by a word or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady, proper, and\nregular motion. But amid these cares her anxiety about Pierre was evident. She kept an anxious watch on him when he approached the\ngroup round Mortemart to listen to what was being said there, and again when he passed to another group whose center was the abbé.\n\nPierre had been educated abroad, and this reception at Anna Pávlovna’s was the first he had attended in Russia. He knew that all\nthe intellectual lights of Petersburg were gathered there and, like a child in a toyshop, did not know which way to look, afraid\nof missing any clever conversation that was to be heard. Seeing the self-confident and refined expression on the faces of those\npresent he was always expecting to hear something very profound. At last he came up to Morio. Here the conversation seemed\ninteresting and he stood waiting for an opportunity to express his own views, as young people are fond of doing.\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nAnna Pávlovna’s reception was in full swing. The spindles hummed steadily and ceaselessly on all sides. With the exception of the\naunt, beside whom sat only one elderly lady, who with her thin careworn face was rather out of place in this brilliant society,\nthe whole company had settled into three groups. One, chiefly masculine, had formed round the abbé. Another, of young people, was\ngrouped round the beautiful Princess Hélène, Prince Vasíli’s daughter, and the little Princess Bolkónskaya, very pretty and rosy,\nthough rather too plump for her age. The third group was gathered round Mortemart and Anna Pávlovna.\n\nThe vicomte was a nice-looking young man with soft features and polished manners, who evidently considered himself a celebrity but\nout of politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in which he found himself. Anna Pávlovna was obviously\nserving him up as a treat to her guests. As a clever maître d’hôtel serves up as a specially choice delicacy a piece of meat that\nno one who had seen it in the kitchen would have cared to eat, so Anna Pávlovna served up to her guests, first the vicomte and\nthen the abbé, as peculiarly choice morsels. The group about Mortemart immediately began discussing the murder of the Duc\nd’Enghien. The vicomte said that the Duc d’Enghien had perished by his own magnanimity, and that there were particular reasons for\nBuonaparte’s hatred of him.\n\n“Ah, yes! Do tell us all about it, Vicomte,” said Anna Pávlovna, with a pleasant feeling that there was something à la Louis XV in\nthe sound of that sentence: “Contez nous çela, Vicomte.”\n\nThe vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness to comply. Anna Pávlovna arranged a group round him, inviting\neveryone to listen to his tale.\n\n“The vicomte knew the duc personally,” whispered Anna Pávlovna to one of the guests. “The vicomte is a wonderful raconteur,” said\nshe to another. “How evidently he belongs to the best society,” said she to a third; and the vicomte was served up to the company\nin the choicest and most advantageous style, like a well-garnished joint of roast beef on a hot dish.\n\nThe vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile.\n\n“Come over here, Hélène, dear,” said Anna Pávlovna to the beautiful young princess who was sitting some way off, the center of\nanother group.\n\nThe princess smiled. She rose with the same unchanging smile with which she had first entered the room—the smile of a perfectly\nbeautiful woman. With a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss and ivy, with a gleam of white shoulders, glossy hair,\nand sparkling diamonds, she passed between the men who made way for her, not looking at any of them but smiling on all, as if\ngraciously allowing each the privilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders, back, and bosom—which in the\nfashion of those days were very much exposed—and she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as she moved toward Anna\nPávlovna. Hélène was so lovely that not only did she not show any trace of coquetry, but on the contrary she even appeared shy of\nher unquestionable and all too victorious beauty. She seemed to wish, but to be unable, to diminish its effect.\n\n“How lovely!” said everyone who saw her; and the vicomte lifted his shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something\nextraordinary when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with her unchanging smile.\n\n“Madame, I doubt my ability before such an audience,” said he, smilingly inclining his head.\n\nThe princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considered a reply unnecessary. She smilingly waited. All the time\nthe story was being told she sat upright, glancing now at her beautiful round arm, altered in shape by its pressure on the table,\nnow at her still more beautiful bosom, on which she readjusted a diamond necklace. From time to time she smoothed the folds of her\ndress, and whenever the story produced an effect she glanced at Anna Pávlovna, at once adopted just the expression she saw on the\nmaid of honor’s face, and again relapsed into her radiant smile.\n\nThe little princess had also left the tea table and followed Hélène.\n\n“Wait a moment, I’ll get my work.... Now then, what are you thinking of?” she went on, turning to Prince Hippolyte. “Fetch me my\nworkbag.”\n\nThere was a general movement as the princess, smiling and talking merrily to everyone at once, sat down and gaily arranged herself\nin her seat.\n\n“Now I am all right,” she said, and asking the vicomte to begin, she took up her work.\n\nPrince Hippolyte, having brought the workbag, joined the circle and moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her.\n\nLe charmant Hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary resemblance to his beautiful sister, but yet more by the fact that in\nspite of this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly. His features were like his sister’s, but while in her case everything was lit\nup by a joyous, self-satisfied, youthful, and constant smile of animation, and by the wonderful classic beauty of her figure, his\nface on the contrary was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen self-confidence, while his body was thin and\nweak. His eyes, nose, and mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant, wearied grimace, and his arms and legs always fell into\nunnatural positions.\n\n“It’s not going to be a ghost story?” said he, sitting down beside the princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette, as if without\nthis instrument he could not begin to speak.\n\n“Why no, my dear fellow,” said the astonished narrator, shrugging his shoulders.\n\n“Because I hate ghost stories,” said Prince Hippolyte in a tone which showed that he only understood the meaning of his words\nafter he had uttered them.\n\nHe spoke with such self-confidence that his hearers could not be sure whether what he said was very witty or very stupid. He was\ndressed in a dark-green dress coat, knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nymphe effrayée, as he called it, shoes, and silk\nstockings.\n\nThe vicomte told his tale very neatly. It was an anecdote, then current, to the effect that the Duc d’Enghien had gone secretly to\nParis to visit Mademoiselle George; that at her house he came upon Bonaparte, who also enjoyed the famous actress’ favors, and\nthat in his presence Napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was subject, and was thus at the duc’s\nmercy. The latter spared him, and this magnanimity Bonaparte subsequently repaid by death.\n\nThe story was very pretty and interesting, especially at the point where the rivals suddenly recognized one another; and the\nladies looked agitated.\n\n“Charming!” said Anna Pávlovna with an inquiring glance at the little princess.\n\n“Charming!” whispered the little princess, sticking the needle into her work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of\nthe story prevented her from going on with it.\n\nThe vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully prepared to continue, but just then Anna Pávlovna, who had kept\na watchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her, noticed that he was talking too loudly and vehemently with the abbé, so she\nhurried to the rescue. Pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbé about the balance of power, and the latter,\nevidently interested by the young man’s simple-minded eagerness, was explaining his pet theory. Both were talking and listening\ntoo eagerly and too naturally, which was why Anna Pávlovna disapproved.\n\n“The means are ... the balance of power in Europe and the rights of the people,” the abbé was saying. “It is only necessary for\none powerful nation like Russia—barbaric as she is said to be—to place herself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having\nfor its object the maintenance of the balance of power of Europe, and it would save the world!”\n\n“But how are you to get that balance?” Pierre was beginning.\n\nAt that moment Anna Pávlovna came up and, looking severely at Pierre, asked the Italian how he stood Russian climate. The\nItalian’s face instantly changed and assumed an offensively affected, sugary expression, evidently habitual to him when conversing\nwith women.\n\n“I am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the society, more especially of the feminine society, in which I\nhave had the honor of being received, that I have not yet had time to think of the climate,” said he.\n\nNot letting the abbé and Pierre escape, Anna Pávlovna, the more conveniently to keep them under observation, brought them into the\nlarger circle.\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nJust then another visitor entered the drawing room: Prince Andrew Bolkónski, the little princess’ husband. He was a very handsome\nyoung man, of medium height, with firm, clearcut features. Everything about him, from his weary, bored expression to his quiet,\nmeasured step, offered a most striking contrast to his quiet, little wife. It was evident that he not only knew everyone in the\ndrawing room, but had found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen to them. And among all these faces\nthat he found so tedious, none seemed to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife. He turned away from her with a grimace that\ndistorted his handsome face, kissed Anna Pávlovna’s hand, and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company.\n\n“You are off to the war, Prince?” said Anna Pávlovna.\n\n“General Kutúzov,” said Bolkónski, speaking French and stressing the last syllable of the general’s name like a Frenchman, “has\nbeen pleased to take me as an aide-de-camp....”\n\n“And Lise, your wife?”\n\n“She will go to the country.”\n\n“Are you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife?”\n\n“André,” said his wife, addressing her husband in the same coquettish manner in which she spoke to other men, “the vicomte has\nbeen telling us such a tale about Mademoiselle George and Buonaparte!”\n\nPrince Andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away. Pierre, who from the moment Prince Andrew entered the room had watched him with\nglad, affectionate eyes, now came up and took his arm. Before he looked round Prince Andrew frowned again, expressing his\nannoyance with whoever was touching his arm, but when he saw Pierre’s beaming face he gave him an unexpectedly kind and pleasant\nsmile.\n\n“There now!... So you, too, are in the great world?” said he to Pierre.\n\n“I knew you would be here,” replied Pierre. “I will come to supper with you. May I?” he added in a low voice so as not to disturb\nthe vicomte who was continuing his story.\n\n“No, impossible!” said Prince Andrew, laughing and pressing Pierre’s hand to show that there was no need to ask the question. He\nwished to say something more, but at that moment Prince Vasíli and his daughter got up to go and the two young men rose to let\nthem pass.\n\n“You must excuse me, dear Vicomte,” said Prince Vasíli to the Frenchman, holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to\nprevent his rising. “This unfortunate fete at the ambassador’s deprives me of a pleasure, and obliges me to interrupt you. I am\nvery sorry to leave your enchanting party,” said he, turning to Anna Pávlovna.\n\nHis daughter, Princess Hélène, passed between the chairs, lightly holding up the folds of her dress, and the smile shone still\nmore radiantly on her beautiful face. Pierre gazed at her with rapturous, almost frightened, eyes as she passed him.\n\n“Very lovely,” said Prince Andrew.\n\n“Very,” said Pierre.\n\nIn passing Prince Vasíli seized Pierre’s hand and said to Anna Pávlovna: “Educate this bear for me! He has been staying with me a\nwhole month and this is the first time I have seen him in society. Nothing is so necessary for a young man as the society of\nclever women.”\n\n \n\nAnna Pávlovna smiled and promised to take Pierre in hand. She knew his father to be a connection of Prince Vasíli’s. The elderly\nlady who had been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook Prince Vasíli in the anteroom. All the affectation of\ninterest she had assumed had left her kindly and tear-worn face and it now expressed only anxiety and fear.\n\n“How about my son Borís, Prince?” said she, hurrying after him into the anteroom. “I can’t remain any longer in Petersburg. Tell\nme what news I may take back to my poor boy.”\n\nAlthough Prince Vasíli listened reluctantly and not very politely to the elderly lady, even betraying some impatience, she gave\nhim an ingratiating and appealing smile, and took his hand that he might not go away.\n\n“What would it cost you to say a word to the Emperor, and then he would be transferred to the Guards at once?” said she.\n\n“Believe me, Princess, I am ready to do all I can,” answered Prince Vasíli, “but it is difficult for me to ask the Emperor. I\nshould advise you to appeal to Rumyántsev through Prince Golítsyn. That would be the best way.”\n\nThe elderly lady was a Princess Drubetskáya, belonging to one of the best families in Russia, but she was poor, and having long\nbeen out of society had lost her former influential connections. She had now come to Petersburg to procure an appointment in the\nGuards for her only son. It was, in fact, solely to meet Prince Vasíli that she had obtained an invitation to Anna Pávlovna’s\nreception and had sat listening to the vicomte’s story. Prince Vasíli’s words frightened her, an embittered look clouded her once\nhandsome face, but only for a moment; then she smiled again and clutched Prince Vasíli’s arm more tightly.\n\n“Listen to me, Prince,” said she. “I have never yet asked you for anything and I never will again, nor have I ever reminded you of\nmy father’s friendship for you; but now I entreat you for God’s sake to do this for my son—and I shall always regard you as a\nbenefactor,” she added hurriedly. “No, don’t be angry, but promise! I have asked Golítsyn and he has refused. Be the kindhearted\nman you always were,” she said, trying to smile though tears were in her eyes.\n\n“Papa, we shall be late,” said Princess Hélène, turning her beautiful head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she\nstood waiting by the door.\n\nInfluence in society, however, is a capital which has to be economized if it is to last. Prince Vasíli knew this, and having once\nrealized that if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him, he would soon be unable to ask for himself, he became chary of using\nhis influence. But in Princess Drubetskáya’s case he felt, after her second appeal, something like qualms of conscience. She had\nreminded him of what was quite true; he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in his career. Moreover, he could see\nby her manners that she was one of those women—mostly mothers—who, having once made up their minds, will not rest until they have\ngained their end, and are prepared if necessary to go on insisting day after day and hour after hour, and even to make scenes.\nThis last consideration moved him.\n\n“My dear Anna Mikháylovna,” said he with his usual familiarity and weariness of tone, “it is almost impossible for me to do what\nyou ask; but to prove my devotion to you and how I respect your father’s memory, I will do the impossible—your son shall be\ntransferred to the Guards. Here is my hand on it. Are you satisfied?”\n\n“My dear benefactor! This is what I expected from you—I knew your kindness!” He turned to go.\n\n“Wait—just a word! When he has been transferred to the Guards...” she faltered. “You are on good terms with Michael Ilariónovich\nKutúzov ... recommend Borís to him as adjutant! Then I shall be at rest, and then...”\n\nPrince Vasíli smiled.\n\n“No, I won’t promise that. You don’t know how Kutúzov is pestered since his appointment as Commander in Chief. He told me himself\nthat all the Moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as adjutants.”\n\n“No, but do promise! I won’t let you go! My dear benefactor...”\n\n“Papa,” said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before, “we shall be late.”\n\n“Well, au revoir! Good-by! You hear her?”\n\n“Then tomorrow you will speak to the Emperor?”\n\n“Certainly; but about Kutúzov, I don’t promise.”\n\n“Do promise, do promise, Vasíli!” cried Anna Mikháylovna as he went, with the smile of a coquettish girl, which at one time\nprobably came naturally to her, but was now very ill-suited to her careworn face.\n\nApparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employed all the old feminine arts. But as soon as the prince had gone\nher face resumed its former cold, artificial expression. She returned to the group where the vicomte was still talking, and again\npretended to listen, while waiting till it would be time to leave. Her task was accomplished",
  "contentHtml": "<div>\r\n<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the Buonapartes. But I warn you, if you don&rsquo;t tell me that this means war, if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that Antichrist&mdash;I really believe he is Antichrist&mdash;I will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my &lsquo;faithful slave,&rsquo; as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have frightened you&mdash;sit down and tell me all the news.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna P&aacute;vlovna Sch&eacute;rer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress M&aacute;rya F&euml;dorovna. With these words she greeted Prince Vas&iacute;li Kur&aacute;gin, a man of high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna P&aacute;vlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from&nbsp;<em>la grippe; grippe</em>&nbsp;being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the elite.</p>\r\n<p>All her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;If you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10&mdash;Annette Sch&eacute;rer.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Heavens! what a virulent attack!&rdquo; replied the prince, not in the least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna P&aacute;vlovna, kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head, and complacently seated himself on the sofa.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend&rsquo;s mind at rest,&rdquo; said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like these if one has any feeling?&rdquo; said Anna P&aacute;vlovna. &ldquo;You are staying the whole evening, I hope?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;And the fete at the English ambassador&rsquo;s? Today is Wednesday. I must put in an appearance there,&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;My daughter is coming for me to take me there.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I thought today&rsquo;s fete had been canceled. I confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been put off,&rdquo; said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novos&iacute;ltsev&rsquo;s dispatch? You know everything.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;What can one say about it?&rdquo; replied the prince in a cold, listless tone. &ldquo;What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Prince Vas&iacute;li always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale part. Anna P&aacute;vlovna Sch&eacute;rer on the contrary, despite her forty years, overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile which, though it did not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed, as in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect, which she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to correct.</p>\r\n<p>In the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna P&aacute;vlovna burst out:</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I don&rsquo;t understand things, but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war. She is betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracious sovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it. That is the one thing I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform the noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble that God will not forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of revolution, which has become more terrible than ever in the person of this murderer and villain! We alone must avenge the blood of the just one.... Whom, I ask you, can we rely on?... England with her commercial spirit will not and cannot understand the Emperor Alexander&rsquo;s loftiness of soul. She has refused to evacuate Malta. She wanted to find, and still seeks, some secret motive in our actions. What answer did Novos&iacute;ltsev get? None. The English have not understood and cannot understand the self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for himself, but only desires the good of mankind. And what have they promised? Nothing! And what little they have promised they will not perform! Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and that all Europe is powerless before him.... And I don&rsquo;t believe a word that Hardenburg says, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian neutrality is just a trap. I have faith only in God and the lofty destiny of our adored monarch. He will save Europe!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>She suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said the prince with a smile, &ldquo;that if you had been sent instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the King of Prussia&rsquo;s consent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will you give me a cup of tea?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;In a moment.&nbsp;<em>&Agrave; propos</em>,&rdquo; she added, becoming calm again, &ldquo;I am expecting two very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart, who is connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of the best French families. He is one of the genuine&nbsp;<em>&eacute;migr&eacute;s</em>, the good ones. And also the Abb&eacute; Morio. Do you know that profound thinker? He has been received by the Emperor. Had you heard?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I shall be delighted to meet them,&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;But tell me,&rdquo; he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him, though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his visit, &ldquo;is it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke to be appointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all accounts is a poor creature.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Prince Vas&iacute;li wished to obtain this post for his son, but others were trying through the Dowager Empress M&aacute;rya F&euml;dorovna to secure it for the baron.</p>\r\n<p>Anna P&aacute;vlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor anyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or was pleased with.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her sister,&rdquo; was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone.</p>\r\n<p>As she named the Empress, Anna P&aacute;vlovna&rsquo;s face suddenly assumed an expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with sadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious patroness. She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron Funke&nbsp;<em>beaucoup d&rsquo;estime</em>, and again her face clouded over with sadness.</p>\r\n<p>The prince was silent and looked indifferent. But, with the womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, Anna P&aacute;vlovna wished both to rebuke him (for daring to speak as he had done of a man recommended to the Empress) and at the same time to console him, so she said:</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Now about your family. Do you know that since your daughter came out everyone has been enraptured by her? They say she is amazingly beautiful.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I often think,&rdquo; she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate conversation&mdash;&ldquo;I often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are distributed. Why has fate given you two such splendid children? I don&rsquo;t speak of Anatole, your youngest. I don&rsquo;t like him,&rdquo; she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows. &ldquo;Two such charming children. And really you appreciate them less than anyone, and so you don&rsquo;t deserve to have them.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>And she smiled her ecstatic smile.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;Lavater would have said I lack the bump of paternity.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you know I am dissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselves&rdquo; (and her face assumed its melancholy expression), &ldquo;he was mentioned at Her Majesty&rsquo;s and you were pitied....&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly, awaiting a reply. He frowned.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;What would you have me do?&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;You know I did all a father could for their education, and they have both turned out fools. Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active one. That is the only difference between them.&rdquo; He said this smiling in a way more natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles round his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;And why are children born to such men as you? If you were not a father there would be nothing I could reproach you with,&rdquo; said Anna P&aacute;vlovna, looking up pensively.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my children are the bane of my life. It is the cross I have to bear. That is how I explain it to myself. It can&rsquo;t be helped!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>He said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a gesture. Anna P&aacute;vlovna meditated.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;They say old maids have a mania for matchmaking, and though I don&rsquo;t feel that weakness in myself as yet, I know a little person who is very unhappy with her father. She is a relation of yours, Princess Mary Bolk&oacute;nskaya.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Prince Vas&iacute;li did not reply, though, with the quickness of memory and perception befitting a man of the world, he indicated by a movement of the head that he was considering this information.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he said at last, evidently unable to check the sad current of his thoughts, &ldquo;that Anatole is costing me forty thousand rubles a year? And,&rdquo; he went on after a pause, &ldquo;what will it be in five years, if he goes on like this?&rdquo; Presently he added: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we fathers have to put up with.... Is this princess of yours rich?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Her father is very rich and stingy. He lives in the country. He is the well-known Prince Bolk&oacute;nski who had to retire from the army under the late Emperor, and was nicknamed &lsquo;the King of Prussia.&rsquo; He is very clever but eccentric, and a bore. The poor girl is very unhappy. She has a brother; I think you know him, he married Lise Meinen lately. He is an aide-de-camp of Kut&uacute;zov&rsquo;s and will be here tonight.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Listen, dear Annette,&rdquo; said the prince, suddenly taking Anna P&aacute;vlovna&rsquo;s hand and for some reason drawing it downwards. &ldquo;Arrange that affair for me and I shall always be your most devoted slave-<em>slafe</em>&nbsp;with an&nbsp;<em>f</em>, as a village elder of mine writes in his reports. She is rich and of good family and that&rsquo;s all I want.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>And with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him, he raised the maid of honor&rsquo;s hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to and fro as he lay back in his armchair, looking in another direction.</p>\r\n<p><em>&ldquo;Attendez,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;said Anna P&aacute;vlovna, reflecting, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll speak to Lise, young Bolk&oacute;nski&rsquo;s wife, this very evening, and perhaps the thing can be arranged. It shall be on your family&rsquo;s behalf that I&rsquo;ll start my apprenticeship as old maid.&rdquo;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2><a></a>CHAPTER II</h2>\r\n<p>Anna P&aacute;vlovna&rsquo;s drawing room was gradually filling. The highest Petersburg society was assembled there: people differing widely in age and character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged. Prince Vas&iacute;li&rsquo;s daughter, the beautiful H&eacute;l&egrave;ne, came to take her father to the ambassador&rsquo;s entertainment; she wore a ball dress and her badge as maid of honor. The youthful little Princess Bolk&oacute;nskaya, known as&nbsp;<em>la femme la plus s&eacute;duisante de P&eacute;tersbourg</em>, * was also there. She had been married during the previous winter, and being pregnant did not go to any large gatherings, but only to small receptions. Prince Vas&iacute;li&rsquo;s son, Hippolyte, had come with Mortemart, whom he introduced. The Abb&eacute; Morio and many others had also come.</p>\r\n<p>* The most fascinating woman in Petersburg.</p>\r\n<p>To each new arrival Anna P&aacute;vlovna said, &ldquo;You have not yet seen my aunt,&rdquo; or &ldquo;You do not know my aunt?&rdquo; and very gravely conducted him or her to a little old lady, wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap, who had come sailing in from another room as soon as the guests began to arrive; and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt, Anna P&aacute;vlovna mentioned each one&rsquo;s name and then left them.</p>\r\n<p>Each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not one of them knew, not one of them wanted to know, and not one of them cared about; Anna P&aacute;vlovna observed these greetings with mournful and solemn interest and silent approval. The aunt spoke to each of them in the same words, about their health and her own, and the health of Her Majesty, &ldquo;who, thank God, was better today.&rdquo; And each visitor, though politeness prevented his showing impatience, left the old woman with a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not return to her the whole evening.</p>\r\n<p>The young Princess Bolk&oacute;nskaya had brought some work in a gold-embroidered velvet bag. Her pretty little upper lip, on which a delicate dark down was just perceptible, was too short for her teeth, but it lifted all the more sweetly, and was especially charming when she occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip. As is always the case with a thoroughly attractive woman, her defect&mdash;the shortness of her upper lip and her half-open mouth&mdash;seemed to be her own special and peculiar form of beauty. Everyone brightened at the sight of this pretty young woman, so soon to become a mother, so full of life and health, and carrying her burden so lightly. Old men and dull dispirited young ones who looked at her, after being in her company and talking to her a little while, felt as if they too were becoming, like her, full of life and health. All who talked to her, and at each word saw her bright smile and the constant gleam of her white teeth, thought that they were in a specially amiable mood that day.</p>\r\n<p>The little princess went round the table with quick, short, swaying steps, her workbag on her arm, and gaily spreading out her dress sat down on a sofa near the silver samovar, as if all she was doing was a pleasure to herself and to all around her. &ldquo;I have brought my work,&rdquo; said she in French, displaying her bag and addressing all present. &ldquo;Mind, Annette, I hope you have not played a wicked trick on me,&rdquo; she added, turning to her hostess. &ldquo;You wrote that it was to be quite a small reception, and just see how badly I am dressed.&rdquo; And she spread out her arms to show her short-waisted, lace-trimmed, dainty gray dress, girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;<em>Soyez tranquille, Lise</em>, you will always be prettier than anyone else,&rdquo; replied Anna P&aacute;vlovna.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in French, turning to a general, &ldquo;my husband is deserting me? He is going to get himself killed. Tell me what this wretched war is for?&rdquo; she added, addressing Prince Vas&iacute;li, and without waiting for an answer she turned to speak to his daughter, the beautiful H&eacute;l&egrave;ne.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;What a delightful woman this little princess is!&rdquo; said Prince Vas&iacute;li to Anna P&aacute;vlovna.</p>\r\n<p>One of the next arrivals was a stout, heavily built young man with close-cropped hair, spectacles, the light-colored breeches fashionable at that time, a very high ruffle, and a brown dress coat. This stout young man was an illegitimate son of Count Bez&uacute;khov, a well-known grandee of Catherine&rsquo;s time who now lay dying in Moscow. The young man had not yet entered either the military or civil service, as he had only just returned from abroad where he had been educated, and this was his first appearance in society. Anna P&aacute;vlovna greeted him with the nod she accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room. But in spite of this lowest-grade greeting, a look of anxiety and fear, as at the sight of something too large and unsuited to the place, came over her face when she saw Pierre enter. Though he was certainly rather bigger than the other men in the room, her anxiety could only have reference to the clever though shy, but observant and natural, expression which distinguished him from everyone else in that drawing room.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It is very good of you, Monsieur Pierre, to come and visit a poor invalid,&rdquo; said Anna P&aacute;vlovna, exchanging an alarmed glance with her aunt as she conducted him to her.</p>\r\n<p>Pierre murmured something unintelligible, and continued to look round as if in search of something. On his way to the aunt he bowed to the little princess with a pleased smile, as to an intimate acquaintance.</p>\r\n<p>Anna P&aacute;vlovna&rsquo;s alarm was justified, for Pierre turned away from the aunt without waiting to hear her speech about Her Majesty&rsquo;s health. Anna P&aacute;vlovna in dismay detained him with the words: &ldquo;Do you know the Abb&eacute; Morio? He is a most interesting man.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace, and it is very interesting but hardly feasible.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You think so?&rdquo; rejoined Anna P&aacute;vlovna in order to say something and get away to attend to her duties as hostess. But Pierre now committed a reverse act of impoliteness. First he had left a lady before she had finished speaking to him, and now he continued to speak to another who wished to get away. With his head bent, and his big feet spread apart, he began explaining his reasons for thinking the abb&eacute;&rsquo;s plan chimerical.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We will talk of it later,&rdquo; said Anna P&aacute;vlovna with a smile.</p>\r\n<p>And having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave, she resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch, ready to help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag. As the foreman of a spinning mill, when he has set the hands to work, goes round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that creaks or makes more noise than it should, and hastens to check the machine or set it in proper motion, so Anna P&aacute;vlovna moved about her drawing room, approaching now a silent, now a too-noisy group, and by a word or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady, proper, and regular motion. But amid these cares her anxiety about Pierre was evident. She kept an anxious watch on him when he approached the group round Mortemart to listen to what was being said there, and again when he passed to another group whose center was the abb&eacute;.</p>\r\n<p>Pierre had been educated abroad, and this reception at Anna P&aacute;vlovna&rsquo;s was the first he had attended in Russia. He knew that all the intellectual lights of Petersburg were gathered there and, like a child in a toyshop, did not know which way to look, afraid of missing any clever conversation that was to be heard. Seeing the self-confident and refined expression on the faces of those present he was always expecting to hear something very profound. At last he came up to Morio. Here the conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an opportunity to express his own views, as young people are fond of doing.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2><a></a>CHAPTER III</h2>\r\n<p>Anna P&aacute;vlovna&rsquo;s reception was in full swing. The spindles hummed steadily and ceaselessly on all sides. With the exception of the aunt, beside whom sat only one elderly lady, who with her thin careworn face was rather out of place in this brilliant society, the whole company had settled into three groups. One, chiefly masculine, had formed round the abb&eacute;. Another, of young people, was grouped round the beautiful Princess H&eacute;l&egrave;ne, Prince Vas&iacute;li&rsquo;s daughter, and the little Princess Bolk&oacute;nskaya, very pretty and rosy, though rather too plump for her age. The third group was gathered round Mortemart and Anna P&aacute;vlovna.</p>\r\n<p>The vicomte was a nice-looking young man with soft features and polished manners, who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out of politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in which he found himself. Anna P&aacute;vlovna was obviously serving him up as a treat to her guests. As a clever ma&icirc;tre d&rsquo;h&ocirc;tel serves up as a specially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in the kitchen would have cared to eat, so Anna P&aacute;vlovna served up to her guests, first the vicomte and then the abb&eacute;, as peculiarly choice morsels. The group about Mortemart immediately began discussing the murder of the Duc d&rsquo;Enghien. The vicomte said that the Duc d&rsquo;Enghien had perished by his own magnanimity, and that there were particular reasons for Buonaparte&rsquo;s hatred of him.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes! Do tell us all about it, Vicomte,&rdquo; said Anna P&aacute;vlovna, with a pleasant feeling that there was something&nbsp;<em>&agrave; la Louis XV</em>&nbsp;in the sound of that sentence:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Contez nous &ccedil;ela, Vicomte.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n<p>The vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness to comply. Anna P&aacute;vlovna arranged a group round him, inviting everyone to listen to his tale.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The vicomte knew the duc personally,&rdquo; whispered Anna P&aacute;vlovna to one of the guests. &ldquo;The vicomte is a wonderful raconteur,&rdquo; said she to another. &ldquo;How evidently he belongs to the best society,&rdquo; said she to a third; and the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest and most advantageous style, like a well-garnished joint of roast beef on a hot dish.</p>\r\n<p>The vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Come over here, H&eacute;l&egrave;ne, dear,&rdquo; said Anna P&aacute;vlovna to the beautiful young princess who was sitting some way off, the center of another group.</p>\r\n<p>The princess smiled. She rose with the same unchanging smile with which she had first entered the room&mdash;the smile of a perfectly beautiful woman. With a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss and ivy, with a gleam of white shoulders, glossy hair, and sparkling diamonds, she passed between the men who made way for her, not looking at any of them but smiling on all, as if graciously allowing each the privilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders, back, and bosom&mdash;which in the fashion of those days were very much exposed&mdash;and she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as she moved toward Anna P&aacute;vlovna. H&eacute;l&egrave;ne was so lovely that not only did she not show any trace of coquetry, but on the contrary she even appeared shy of her unquestionable and all too victorious beauty. She seemed to wish, but to be unable, to diminish its effect.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;How lovely!&rdquo; said everyone who saw her; and the vicomte lifted his shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinary when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with her unchanging smile.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Madame, I doubt my ability before such an audience,&rdquo; said he, smilingly inclining his head.</p>\r\n<p>The princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considered a reply unnecessary. She smilingly waited. All the time the story was being told she sat upright, glancing now at her beautiful round arm, altered in shape by its pressure on the table, now at her still more beautiful bosom, on which she readjusted a diamond necklace. From time to time she smoothed the folds of her dress, and whenever the story produced an effect she glanced at Anna P&aacute;vlovna, at once adopted just the expression she saw on the maid of honor&rsquo;s face, and again relapsed into her radiant smile.</p>\r\n<p>The little princess had also left the tea table and followed H&eacute;l&egrave;ne.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment, I&rsquo;ll get my work.... Now then, what are you thinking of?&rdquo; she went on, turning to Prince Hippolyte. &ldquo;Fetch me my workbag.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>There was a general movement as the princess, smiling and talking merrily to everyone at once, sat down and gaily arranged herself in her seat.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Now I am all right,&rdquo; she said, and asking the vicomte to begin, she took up her work.</p>\r\n<p>Prince Hippolyte, having brought the workbag, joined the circle and moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her.</p>\r\n<p><em>Le charmant Hippolyte</em>&nbsp;was surprising by his extraordinary resemblance to his beautiful sister, but yet more by the fact that in spite of this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly. His features were like his sister&rsquo;s, but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous, self-satisfied, youthful, and constant smile of animation, and by the wonderful classic beauty of her figure, his face on the contrary was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen self-confidence, while his body was thin and weak. His eyes, nose, and mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant, wearied grimace, and his arms and legs always fell into unnatural positions.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not going to be a ghost story?&rdquo; said he, sitting down beside the princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette, as if without this instrument he could not begin to speak.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Why no, my dear fellow,&rdquo; said the astonished narrator, shrugging his shoulders.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Because I hate ghost stories,&rdquo; said Prince Hippolyte in a tone which showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he had uttered them.</p>\r\n<p>He spoke with such self-confidence that his hearers could not be sure whether what he said was very witty or very stupid. He was dressed in a dark-green dress coat, knee breeches of the color of&nbsp;<em>cuisse de nymphe effray&eacute;e</em>, as he called it, shoes, and silk stockings.</p>\r\n<p>The vicomte told his tale very neatly. It was an anecdote, then current, to the effect that the Duc d&rsquo;Enghien had gone secretly to Paris to visit Mademoiselle George; that at her house he came upon Bonaparte, who also enjoyed the famous actress&rsquo; favors, and that in his presence Napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was subject, and was thus at the duc&rsquo;s mercy. The latter spared him, and this magnanimity Bonaparte subsequently repaid by death.</p>\r\n<p>The story was very pretty and interesting, especially at the point where the rivals suddenly recognized one another; and the ladies looked agitated.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Charming!&rdquo; said Anna P&aacute;vlovna with an inquiring glance at the little princess.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Charming!&rdquo; whispered the little princess, sticking the needle into her work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the story prevented her from going on with it.</p>\r\n<p>The vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully prepared to continue, but just then Anna P&aacute;vlovna, who had kept a watchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her, noticed that he was talking too loudly and vehemently with the abb&eacute;, so she hurried to the rescue. Pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abb&eacute; about the balance of power, and the latter, evidently interested by the young man&rsquo;s simple-minded eagerness, was explaining his pet theory. Both were talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally, which was why Anna P&aacute;vlovna disapproved.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The means are ... the balance of power in Europe and the rights of the people,&rdquo; the abb&eacute; was saying. &ldquo;It is only necessary for one powerful nation like Russia&mdash;barbaric as she is said to be&mdash;to place herself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its object the maintenance of the balance of power of Europe, and it would save the world!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;But how are you to get that balance?&rdquo; Pierre was beginning.</p>\r\n<p>At that moment Anna P&aacute;vlovna came up and, looking severely at Pierre, asked the Italian how he stood Russian climate. The Italian&rsquo;s face instantly changed and assumed an offensively affected, sugary expression, evidently habitual to him when conversing with women.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the society, more especially of the feminine society, in which I have had the honor of being received, that I have not yet had time to think of the climate,&rdquo; said he.</p>\r\n<p>Not letting the abb&eacute; and Pierre escape, Anna P&aacute;vlovna, the more conveniently to keep them under observation, brought them into the larger circle.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2><a></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>\r\n<p>Just then another visitor entered the drawing room: Prince Andrew Bolk&oacute;nski, the little princess&rsquo; husband. He was a very handsome young man, of medium height, with firm, clearcut features. Everything about him, from his weary, bored expression to his quiet, measured step, offered a most striking contrast to his quiet, little wife. It was evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing room, but had found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen to them. And among all these faces that he found so tedious, none seemed to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife. He turned away from her with a grimace that distorted his handsome face, kissed Anna P&aacute;vlovna&rsquo;s hand, and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You are off to the war, Prince?&rdquo; said Anna P&aacute;vlovna.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;General Kut&uacute;zov,&rdquo; said Bolk&oacute;nski, speaking French and stressing the last syllable of the general&rsquo;s name like a Frenchman, &ldquo;has been pleased to take me as an aide-de-camp....&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;And Lise, your wife?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;She will go to the country.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Are you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><em>&ldquo;Andr&eacute;,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;said his wife, addressing her husband in the same coquettish manner in which she spoke to other men, &ldquo;the vicomte has been telling us such a tale about Mademoiselle George and Buonaparte!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Prince Andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away. Pierre, who from the moment Prince Andrew entered the room had watched him with glad, affectionate eyes, now came up and took his arm. Before he looked round Prince Andrew frowned again, expressing his annoyance with whoever was touching his arm, but when he saw Pierre&rsquo;s beaming face he gave him an unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;There now!... So you, too, are in the great world?&rdquo; said he to Pierre.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I knew you would be here,&rdquo; replied Pierre. &ldquo;I will come to supper with you. May I?&rdquo; he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the vicomte who was continuing his story.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;No, impossible!&rdquo; said Prince Andrew, laughing and pressing Pierre&rsquo;s hand to show that there was no need to ask the question. He wished to say something more, but at that moment Prince Vas&iacute;li and his daughter got up to go and the two young men rose to let them pass.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You must excuse me, dear Vicomte,&rdquo; said Prince Vas&iacute;li to the Frenchman, holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent his rising. &ldquo;This unfortunate fete at the ambassador&rsquo;s deprives me of a pleasure, and obliges me to interrupt you. I am very sorry to leave your enchanting party,&rdquo; said he, turning to Anna P&aacute;vlovna.</p>\r\n<p>His daughter, Princess H&eacute;l&egrave;ne, passed between the chairs, lightly holding up the folds of her dress, and the smile shone still more radiantly on her beautiful face. Pierre gazed at her with rapturous, almost frightened, eyes as she passed him.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Very lovely,&rdquo; said Prince Andrew.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; said Pierre.</p>\r\n<p>In passing Prince Vas&iacute;li seized Pierre&rsquo;s hand and said to Anna P&aacute;vlovna: &ldquo;Educate this bear for me! He has been staying with me a whole month and this is the first time I have seen him in society. Nothing is so necessary for a young man as the society of clever women.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Anna P&aacute;vlovna smiled and promised to take Pierre in hand. She knew his father to be a connection of Prince Vas&iacute;li&rsquo;s. The elderly lady who had been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook Prince Vas&iacute;li in the anteroom. All the affectation of interest she had assumed had left her kindly and tear-worn face and it now expressed only anxiety and fear.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;How about my son Bor&iacute;s, Prince?&rdquo; said she, hurrying after him into the anteroom. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remain any longer in Petersburg. Tell me what news I may take back to my poor boy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Although Prince Vas&iacute;li listened reluctantly and not very politely to the elderly lady, even betraying some impatience, she gave him an ingratiating and appealing smile, and took his hand that he might not go away.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;What would it cost you to say a word to the Emperor, and then he would be transferred to the Guards at once?&rdquo; said she.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Believe me, Princess, I am ready to do all I can,&rdquo; answered Prince Vas&iacute;li, &ldquo;but it is difficult for me to ask the Emperor. I should advise you to appeal to Rumy&aacute;ntsev through Prince Gol&iacute;tsyn. That would be the best way.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The elderly lady was a Princess Drubetsk&aacute;ya, belonging to one of the best families in Russia, but she was poor, and having long been out of society had lost her former influential connections. She had now come to Petersburg to procure an appointment in the Guards for her only son. It was, in fact, solely to meet Prince Vas&iacute;li that she had obtained an invitation to Anna P&aacute;vlovna&rsquo;s reception and had sat listening to the vicomte&rsquo;s story. Prince Vas&iacute;li&rsquo;s words frightened her, an embittered look clouded her once handsome face, but only for a moment; then she smiled again and clutched Prince Vas&iacute;li&rsquo;s arm more tightly.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Listen to me, Prince,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I have never yet asked you for anything and I never will again, nor have I ever reminded you of my father&rsquo;s friendship for you; but now I entreat you for God&rsquo;s sake to do this for my son&mdash;and I shall always regard you as a benefactor,&rdquo; she added hurriedly. &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t be angry, but promise! I have asked Gol&iacute;tsyn and he has refused. Be the kindhearted man you always were,&rdquo; she said, trying to smile though tears were in her eyes.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Papa, we shall be late,&rdquo; said Princess H&eacute;l&egrave;ne, turning her beautiful head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she stood waiting by the door.</p>\r\n<p>Influence in society, however, is a capital which has to be economized if it is to last. Prince Vas&iacute;li knew this, and having once realized that if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him, he would soon be unable to ask for himself, he became chary of using his influence. But in Princess Drubetsk&aacute;ya&rsquo;s case he felt, after her second appeal, something like qualms of conscience. She had reminded him of what was quite true; he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in his career. Moreover, he could see by her manners that she was one of those women&mdash;mostly mothers&mdash;who, having once made up their minds, will not rest until they have gained their end, and are prepared if necessary to go on insisting day after day and hour after hour, and even to make scenes. This last consideration moved him.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;My dear Anna Mikh&aacute;ylovna,&rdquo; said he with his usual familiarity and weariness of tone, &ldquo;it is almost impossible for me to do what you ask; but to prove my devotion to you and how I respect your father&rsquo;s memory, I will do the impossible&mdash;your son shall be transferred to the Guards. Here is my hand on it. Are you satisfied?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;My dear benefactor! This is what I expected from you&mdash;I knew your kindness!&rdquo; He turned to go.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Wait&mdash;just a word! When he has been transferred to the Guards...&rdquo; she faltered. &ldquo;You are on good terms with Michael Ilari&oacute;novich Kut&uacute;zov ... recommend Bor&iacute;s to him as adjutant! Then I shall be at rest, and then...&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Prince Vas&iacute;li smiled.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t promise that. You don&rsquo;t know how Kut&uacute;zov is pestered since his appointment as Commander in Chief. He told me himself that all the Moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as adjutants.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;No, but do promise! I won&rsquo;t let you go! My dear benefactor...&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before, &ldquo;we shall be late.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Well,&nbsp;<em>au revoir!</em>&nbsp;Good-by! You hear her?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Then tomorrow you will speak to the Emperor?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Certainly; but about Kut&uacute;zov, I don&rsquo;t promise.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Do promise, do promise, Vas&iacute;li!&rdquo; cried Anna Mikh&aacute;ylovna as he went, with the smile of a coquettish girl, which at one time probably came naturally to her, but was now very ill-suited to her careworn face.</p>\r\n<p>Apparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employed all the old feminine arts. But as soon as the prince had gone her face resumed its former cold, artificial expression. She returned to the group where the vicomte was still talking, and again pretended to listen, while waiting till it would be time to leave. Her task was accomplished</p>\r\n</div>",

  "shortDescription": "Preface\r\nBeing a True Account of How a Priceless Cargo Was Delivered to a Desert Islander\r\nHow that I, Robinson Crusoe, came to be wrecked with others of the ship’s company on a Desert Island, all being lost save my unworthy self, hath in a precise manner been narrated by one D. Defoe in the book he saw fit to entitle with my name; but his ending is indifferent. For novels like Defoe’s must have the Happy Ending, so styled. Yet is the truth often happier far than fiction. Being no hand to invent a tale, I am content to set down in this place events as I humbly took part in them.\r\n\r\nLet me declare, then, that here on my Desert Island I for long suffered great loneliness and consequent distress of soul. This went on many days. Howbeit, while sunk very low in my spiritual state and with expectation nearly gone, a huge ship passing near labored painfully with a storm by the mercy of God being compelled to throw overboard—or, as they say at sea, to jettison—the greater part of her cargo. And being thus lightened she stood away from the Island and went on her course safely. The same storm cast upon the shore the rich treasure wherewith she had been laden, so many wooden boxes or cases, packed tightly and well-lined, which for the most part were washed up undamaged and,[viii] within, scarcely dampened except it may be for an inch or two. Coming down to the shore the morning after I stood transfixed with astonishment at the sight of something lying on the sand. It was a book.\r\n\r\nWhen I had a little recovered from my amaze, my joy and ecstasy knew no way to communicate itself, and almost immediately, my eye falling on the cases strewn along the beach, I capered with delight. I brake open the boxes, one after the other fast as I could work. All, all, were brimmed with the newest books!\r\n\r\nSince that day I have not lacked instruction and entertainment, and deem that Providence, at trifling expense to the maritime insurers, hath rescued me from boredom forevermore. And this I deem the only rescue worth a fingersnap in this life of ours, and one that a great majority of people do never accomplish. My days and nights have been and yet are filled with most various delights, my walks are taken with a great company of authors and my conversations are held with them.\r\n\r\nWith such profit and satisfaction do I read that more than once, being sighted by a vessel which then stood by to take me off my Island, I have waved the sailors to proceed without me, which they have done with doubt and difficulty; yet finally I have convinced them of my meaning, they proceeding with their voyage, I with mine....",
  "contentText": "1. THE KNIGHTLINESS OF PHILIP GIBBS\n\n\nI\n\nThen one said: “Rise, Sir Philip——” but the terms in which the still young man received ennoblement were heard by none; for all\nwere drawn by his face in which austerity and gentleness seemed mingled. A pale young man with a nicotine-stained third finger\nwhom Arnold Bennett had once warned authors against (he asks you to lunch and drives a hard bargain over the coffee). A good\nreporter for Alfred Harmsworth, Lord Northcliffe. A war correspondent with seven-league boots. A man standing on a platform in\nCarnegie Hall which rings with riot “looking like a frightfully tired Savonarola who is speaking in a trance.” His thin,\nuncompromising nose; the jut of the chin; the high cheekbones and the hollow cheeks, long upper lip and mouth with drawn-in,\nstraight corners (yet a compassionate mouth); the deep-set eyes; the ears placed so far back, and the raking line of the jaw—if\nthese were all he might be nothing better than a fine breed of news hound with “points.” They are nothing; but the clear shine of\nidealism from eye and countenance is the whole man. Great Britain had knighted a reporter, but Philip Gibbs had been born to\nknighthood.\n\n[16]\n\nFor when chivalry would have died, he first succored and then revived it; when men wished to forget, he compelled them to\nremember. He actually proves what men have forgotten how to prove, and so have turned into a copybook maxim. Perhaps the reason\nhis pen is mightier than any sword is because he wields it as if it were one.\n\nIn the eyes of the world he is the D’Artagnan of Three Musketeers who are also three brothers. They are Philip (Hamilton) Gibbs,\nCosmo Hamilton (Gibbs), and A(rthur) Hamilton Gibbs, the mutations of name arising from choice and even from a certain literary\nnecessity; for an author’s name should be distinctive and is usually better not to be too long. The father, Henry Gibbs, was an\nEnglish civil servant, a departmental chief in the Board of Education. The mother had been Helen Hamilton. The family at one time\nconsisted of six boys and two girls. Henry Gibbs had “a delicate wife, an unresilient salary, and his spirit of taking chances had\nbeen killed by heavy responsibility, the caution and timidity growing out of a painful knowledge of the risks and difficulties of\nlife, and the undermining security of having sat all his working years in the safe cul-de-sac of a government office.”[1]\n[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/68092/68092-h/68092-h.htm#Footnote_1] It was the office in which Matthew Arnold worked and in\nwhich an obscure temporary clerk, W. S. Gilbert, stole moments to compose some verse called Bab Ballads. Henry Gibbs was a famous\nafter-dinner speaker and it was certainly he who preserved the Carlyle House for London, but the nature of the case forbade him to\nencourage the marked adventurous strain in his boys.\n\nPHILIP GIBBS\n\n[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/68092/68092-h/images/illus1.jpg]\n\nCopyright by Underwood & Underwood.\n\nPhilip Gibbs was educated privately and was an editor before he was 21. He was, in fact, only 19 when[17] he became “educational\neditor” for the large English publishing firm of Cassell at a salary of a hundred and twenty pounds a year. “With five pounds\ncapital and that income, I married”—Agnes Rowland, daughter of the Rev. W. J. Rowland—“with an audacity which I now find superb. I\nwas so young, and looked so much younger, that I did not dare to confess my married state to my official chief, who was the Right\nHonorable H. O. Arnold-Forster, in whose room I sat, and one day when my wife popped her head through the door and said ‘Hullo!’ I\nmade signs to her to depart.\n\n“‘Who’s that pretty girl?’ asked Arnold-Forster, and with shame I must confess that I hid the secret of our relationship.”[2]\n[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/68092/68092-h/68092-h.htm#Footnote_2]\n\nHe was both timid and bashful; yet like many men of his stamp, he was to show on many occasions a lion-like courage. A hundred and\na thousand times he was to pass as close to death as a man may pass and yet live; in general, he was to be quite as badly scared\nas a chap can be in such circumstances; and without exception he was to persist in what he was doing, for there was and is in him\nsomething stronger than fear.\n\n\nII\n\nPhilip Gibbs’s earlier career differed little from that of Arnold Bennett or the first years of dozens of Englishmen who have made\ntheir start in Fleet Street. After several years with Cassell, he applied for and got a job as managing editor of a large literary\nsyndicate. In this post he bought Bennett’s early novel, The Grand Babylon Hotel, and other fiction and articles to be sold to\nnewspapers in Great Britain and the colonies. While with Cassell he had written his first book,[18] Founders of the Empire, a\nhistorical text still used in English schools. As a syndicate editor he wrote articles on every conceivable subject, particularly\na weekly essay called “Knowledge is Power.” But his job was outside of London, for which he hankered; and finally he wrote to\nAlfred Harmsworth, who was later to become Lord Northcliffe and who had founded the Daily Mail. The result was a job under a\nbrilliant journalist, Filson Young, whom Gibbs succeeded a few months later as editor of Page Four in the Mail (devoted to special\narticles). Here he learned all about the new journalism and had a chance to observe Northcliffe closely. In the seventh chapter of\nhis Adventures in Journalism, Philip Gibbs gives a brief but well-etched portrait of the man who transformed the character of the\nEnglish newspaper. Northcliffe’s genius, his generosity, his ruthlessness—which was often the result of indifference and sometimes\nsprang from fatigue and bad temper—are very well conveyed in a half dozen pages. Gibbs suffered the fate of nearly all this man’s\ntemporary favorites. When he was dismissed from the Daily Mail he went for a few months to the Daily Express before beginning what\nwas to be a long association with the Daily Chronicle.\n\nHis connection with the Chronicle was broken by the sad experiment of the Tribune, a newspaper founded by a melancholy young man\nnamed Franklin Thomasson as a pious carrying out of his father’s wishes. As literary editor of this daily, Philip Gibbs bought\nwork by Rudyard Kipling, Joseph Conrad and Gilbert K. Chesterton, but the paper as a whole was dull and doomed. When it went down,\nPhilip Gibbs thought he saw a chance to throw off the bondage of offices. He took his wife and little son and retreated to a\ncoast-guard’s cottage at Littlehampton. “There,[19] in a tiny room, filled with the murmur of the sea, and the vulgar songs of\nseaside Pierrots, I wrote my novel, The Street of Adventure, in which I told, in the guise of fiction, the history of the Tribune\nnewspaper, and gave a picture of the squalor, disappointment, adventure, insecurity, futility, and good comradeship of Fleet\nStreet.” There was need of money, but the novel cost Gibbs more than it earned. His narrative had not disguised sufficiently\neither the newspaper or members of its late staff. The point is a little difficult for American readers to take in, and rests on\nEnglish libel law, which is quite different from the American. In England, “the greater the truth, the greater the libel.” A libel\naction was instituted, and although it was finally withdrawn, the bills of costs were heavy and the sale had been killed. But when\npublished in the United States after the war, The Street of Adventure had a very good success.\n\n“I knew after that the wear and tear, the mental distress, the financial uncertainty that befell a free lance in search of fame\nand fortune, when those mocking will-o’-the-wisps lead him through the ditches of disappointment and the thickets of ill luck. How\nmany hundreds of times did I pace the streets of London in those days, vainly seeking the plot of a short story, and haunted by\nelusive characters who would not fit into my combination of circumstances, ending at 4,000 words with a dramatic climax! How many\nhours have I spent glued to a seat in Kensington Gardens, working out literary triangles with a husband and wife and the third\nparty, two men and a woman, two women and a man, and finding only a vicious circle of hopeless imbecility! At such times one’s\nnerves get ‘edgy’ and one’s imagination becomes feverish with effort, so that[20] the more desperately one chases an idea, the\nmore resolutely it eludes one.”[3] [https://www.gutenberg.org/files/68092/68092-h/68092-h.htm#Footnote_3]\n\nYet he counts himself, on the whole, to have been lucky. He was able to earn a living and to give time and labor to “the most\nunprofitable branch of literature, which is history, and my first love.” Years later he was to have a thrill of pleasure at seeing\nin the windows of Paris bookshops his Men and Women of the French Revolution, magnificently illustrated with reproductions of old\nprints. He wrote the romantic life of George Villiers, First Duke of Buckingham, and discovered in the murder of Sir Thomas\nOverbury “a plot with kings and princes, great lords and ladies, bishops and judges, poisoners, witch doctors, cut-throats and\npoets,” the incomparable material for his King’s Favorite. These books brought him only a few hundred dollars apiece, though\nperhaps more in reputation and friendships.\n\n\nIII\n\nHe returned to journalism, eventually, as special correspondent and descriptive writer for the Daily Chronicle. He was rather\nfrequently in charge of the Paris office and had all sorts of adventures in that city, both those derived from saturating himself\nin French history and others incident to his daily work. After the Portuguese revolution he was sent to Portugal to explore the\ncondition of those political prisoners that the republicans had in some cases interred alive. His greatest feat was the revelation\nof Dr. Cook’s fraud in claiming the discovery of the North Pole. This was a triumph of sheer intuition, in the first instance, and\nboth dogged persistency and remarkable courage were necessary before Philip Gibbs could be proved right.\n\n[21]\n\nIt began with a late start, twenty-four hours behind the other correspondents. When Gibbs got to Copenhagen, the vessel bringing\nDr. Cook had not arrived, owing to fogs. Through a chance meeting in a restaurant with Mrs. Rasmussen, wife of the explorer, Gibbs\ngot to Elsinore and aboard a launch which was putting out to meet the delayed ship. Thus he was the only English-speaking person\npresent at the first interview, on shipboard. As it happened, Dr. Cook had not yet acquired that magnificent poise and aplomb\nwhich he was to display from the moment he set foot ashore. His eyes evaded Gibbs, he explained that he had no papers to prove his\nclaim and not even a diary, and when pressed for some sort of written record or notes he exclaimed: “You believed Nansen and\nAmundsen and Sverdrup. They had only their story to tell. Why don’t you believe me?” Later Cook had a moment of utter funk, hiding\nin his cabin. It passed quickly and after that he was outwardly all that a hero should be.\n\nBut Gibbs had had his chance. His seven-column story to the Daily Chronicle caused him to be denounced everywhere and even put him\nin jeopardy of his life in Copenhagen; yet a few weeks were to show it to be one of the greatest exclusive newspaper stories,\n“beats” or “scoops,” ever written.",

She showed off a bit, it is true, playing bird of paradise among the\npigeons. At the same time, she was thrilled to be with us, and out of her own set. Her wistfulness and yearning \"for something\nelse\" was absolutely genuine. Yet she was not going to hobnob with us either, at least not indiscriminately.\n\nShe was ambitious, in a vague way. She wanted to coruscate, somehow or other. She had a family of clever and \"distinguished\"\nuncles, who had flattered her. What then?\n\nHer cactuses-in-a-pot were admirable. But even she didn't expect them to start a revolution. Perhaps she would rather glow in the\nwide if dirty skies of life, than in the somewhat remote and unsatisfactory ether of Art.\n\nShe and I were \"friends\" in a bare, stark, but real sense. I was poor, but I didn't really care. She didn't really care either.\nWhereas I did care about some passionate vision which, I could feel, lay embedded in the half-dead body of this life. The quick\nbody within the dead. I could feel it. And I wanted to get at it, if only for myself.\n\nShe didn't know what I was after. Yet she could feel that I was It, and being an aristocrat of the Kingdom of It, as well as the\nrealm of Great Britain, she was loyal—loyal to me because of It, the quick body which I imagined within the dead.\n\nStill, we never had much to do with one another. I had no money. She never wanted to introduce me to her own people. I didn't want\nit either. Sometimes we had lunch together, sometimes we went to a theatre, or we drove in the country, in some car that belonged\nto neither of us. We never flirted or talked love. I don't think she wanted it, any more than I did. She wanted to marry into her\nown surroundings, and I knew she was of too frail a paste to face my future.\n\nNow I come to think of it, she was always a bit sad when we were together. Perhaps she looked over seas she would never cross. She\nbelonged finally, fatally, to her own class. Yet I think she hated them. When she was in a group of people who talked \"smart,\"\ntitles and beau monde and all that, her rather short nose would turn up, her wide mouth press into discontent, and a languor of\nbored irritation come even over her broad shoulders. Bored irritation, and a loathing of climbers, a loathing of the ladder\naltogether. She hated her own class: yet it was also sacrosanct to her. She disliked, even to me, mentioning the title of her\nfriends. Yet the very hurried resentment with which she said, when I asked her. Who is it?—\n\n\"Lady Nithsdale, Lord Staines—old friends of my mother,\" proved that the coronet was wedged into her brow, like a ring of iron\ngrown into a tree.\n\nShe had another kind of reverence for a true artist: perhaps more genuine, perhaps not; anyhow, more free and easy.\n\nShe and I had a curious understanding in common: an inkling, perhaps, of the unborn body of life hidden within the body of this\nhalf-death which we call life; and hence a tacit hostility to the commonplace world, its inert laws. We were rather like two\nsoldiers on a secret mission in an enemy country. Life, and people, was an enemy country to us both. But she would never declare\nherself.\n\nShe always came to me to find out what I thought, particularly in a moral issue. Profoundly, fretfully discontented with the\nconventional moral standards, she didn't know how to take a stand of her own. So she came to me. She had to try to get her own\nfeelings straightened out. In that she showed her old British fibre. I told her what, as a young man, I thought: and usually she\nwas resentful. She did so want to be conventional. She would even act quite perversely, in her determination to be conventional.\nBut she always had to come back to me, to ask me again. She depended on me morally. Even when she disagreed with me, it soothed\nher, and restored her to know my point of view. Yet she disagreed with me.\n\nWe had then a curious abstract intimacy, that went very deep, yet showed no obvious contact. Perhaps I was the only person in the\nworld with whom she felt, in her uneasy self, at home, at peace. And to me, she was always of my own intrinsic sort, of my own\nspecies. Most people are just another species to me. They might as well be turkeys.\n\nBut she would always act according to the conventions of her class, even perversely. And I knew it.\n\nSo, just before the war she married Lord Lathkill. She was twenty-one. I did not see her till war was declared; then she asked me\nto lunch with her and her husband, in town. He was an officer in a Guards regiment, and happened to be in uniform, looking very\nhandsome and well-set-up, as if he expected to find the best of life served up to him for ever. He was very dark, with dark eyes\nand fine black hair, and a very beautiful, diffident voice, almost womanish in its slow, delicate inflections. He seemed pleased\nand flattered at having Carlotta for a wife.\n\nTo me he was beautifully attentive, almost deferential, because I was poor, and of the other world, those poor devils of\noutsiders. I laughed at him a little, and laughed at Carlotta, who was a bit irritated by the gentle delicacy with which he\ntreated me.\n\nShe was elated too. I remember her saying, \"We need war, don't you think? Don't you think men need the fight, to keep life\nchivalrous and put martial glamour into it?\"\n\nAnd I remember saying, \"I think we need some sort of fight; but my sort isn't the war sort.\" It was August, we could take it\nlightly.\n\n\"What's your sort?\" she asked quickly.\n\n\"I don't know: single-handed, anyhow,\" I said, with a grin. Lord Lathkill made me feel like a lonely sansculotte; he was so\ncompletely unostentatious, so very willing to pay all the attention to me, and yet so subtly complacent, so unquestioningly sure\nof his position. Whereas I was not a very sound earthenware pitcher which had already gone many times to the well.\n\nHe was not conceited, not half as conceited as I was. He was willing to leave me all the front of the stage, even with Carlotta.\nHe felt so sure of some things, like a tortoise in a glittering, polished tortoiseshell that mirrors eternity. Yet he was not\nquite easy with me.\n\n\"You are Derbyshire?\" I said to him, looking into his face. \"So am I! I was born in Derbyshire.\"\n\nHe asked me with a gentle, uneasy sort of politeness, where? But he was a bit taken aback. And his dark eyes, brooding over me,\nhad a sort of fear in them. At the centre they were hollow with a certain misgiving. He was so sure of circumstances, and not by\nany means sure of the man in the middle of the circumstances. Himself! Himself! That was already a ghost.\n\nI felt that he saw in me something crude but real, and saw himself as something in its own way perfect, but quite unreal. Even his\nlove for Carlotta, and his marriage, was a circumstance that was inwardly unreal to him. One could tell by the curious way in\nwhich he waited, before he spoke. And by the hollow look, almost a touch of madness, in his dark eyes, and in his soft, melancholy\nvoice.\n\nI could understand that she was fascinated by him. But God help him if ever circumstances went against him!\n\nShe had to see me again, a week later, to talk about him. So she asked me to the opera. She had a box, and we were alone, and the\nnotorious Lady Perth was two boxes away. But this was one of Carlotta's conventional perverse little acts, with her husband in\nFrance. She only wanted to talk to me about him.\n\nSo she sat in the front of her box, leaning a little to the audience and talking sideways to me. Anyone would have known at once\nthere was a liaison between us, how dangereuse they would never have guessed. For there, in the full view of the world—her world\nat least, not mine—she was talking sideways to me, saying in a hurried, yet stony voice:\n\n\"What do you think of Luke?\"\n\nShe looked up at me heavily, with her sea-coloured eyes, waiting for my answer.\n\n\"He's tremendously charming,\" I said, above the theatreful of faces.\n\n\"Yes, he's that!\" she replied, in the flat, plangent voice she had when she was serious, like metal ringing flat, with a strange\nfar-reaching vibration. \"Do you think he'll be happy?\"\n\n\"Be happy!\" I ejaculated. \"When, be happy?\"\n\n\"With me,\" she said, giving a sudden little snirt of laughter, like a schoolgirl, and looking up at me shyly, mischievously,\nanxiously.\n\n\"If you make him,\" I said, still casual.\n\n\"How can I make him?\"\n\nShe said it with flat, plangent earnestness. She was always like that, pushing me deeper in than I wanted to go.\n\n\"Be happy yourself, I suppose: and quite sure about it. And then tell him you're happy, and tell him he is too, and he'll be it.\"\n\n\"Must I do all that?\" she said rapidly. \"Not otherwise?\"\n\nI knew I was frowning at her, and she was watching my frown.\n\n\"Probably not,\" I said roughly. \"He'll never make up his mind about it himself.\"\n\n\"How did you know?\" she asked, as if it had been a mystery.\n\n\"I didn't. It only seems to me like that.\"\n\n\"Seems to you like that,\" she re-echoed, in that sad, clean monotone of finality, always like metal. I appreciate it in her, that\nshe does not murmur or whisper. But I wished she left me alone, in that beastly theatre.\n\nShe was wearing emeralds, on her snow-white skin, and leaning forward gazing fixedly down into the auditorium, as a crystal-gazer\ninto a crystal. Heaven knows if she saw all those little facets of faces and plastrons. As for me, I knew that, like a\nsansculotte, I should never be king till breeches were off.\n\n\"I had terrible work to make him marry me,\" she said, in her swift, clear low tones.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"He was frightfully in love with me. He is! But he thinks he's unlucky...\"\n\n\"Unlucky, how? In cards or in love?\" I mocked.\n\n\"In both,\" she said briefly, with sudden cold resentment at my flippancy. There was over her eyes a glaze of fear. \"It's in their\nfamily.\"\n\n\"What did you say to him?\" I asked, rather laboured, feeling the dead weight.\n\n\"I promised to have luck for two,\" she said. \"And war was declared a fortnight later.\"\n\n\"Ah, well!\" I said. \"That's the world's luck, not yours.\"\n\n\"Quite!\" she said.\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n\"Is his family supposed to be unlucky?\" I asked.\n\n\"The Worths? Terribly! They really are!\"\n\nIt was interval, and the box door had opened. Carlotta always had her eye, a good half of it at least, on the external happenings.\nShe rose, like a reigning beauty—which she wasn't, and never became—to speak to Lady Perth, and, out of spite, did not introduce\nme.\n\nCarlotta and Lord Lathkill came, perhaps a year later, to visit us when we were in a cottage in Derbyshire, and he was home on\nleave. She was going to have a child, and was slow, and seemed depressed. He was vague, charming, talking about the country and\nthe history of the lead mines. But the two of them seemed vague, as if they never got anywhere.\n\nThe last time I saw them was when the war was over, and I was leaving England. They were alone at dinner, save for me. He was\nstill haggard, with a wound in the throat. But he said he would soon be well. His slow, beautiful voice was a bit husky now. And\nhis velvety eyes were hardened, haggard, but there was weariness, emptiness in the hardness.\n\nI was poorer than ever, and felt a little weary myself. Carlotta was struggling with his silent emptiness. Since the war, the\nmelancholy fixity of his eyes was more noticeable, the fear at the centre was almost monomania. She was wilting and losing her\nbeauty.\n\nThere were twins in the house. After dinner, we went straight up to look at them, to the night nursery. They were two boys, with\ntheir father's fine dark hair, both of them.\n\nHe had put out his cigar, and leaned over the cots, gazing in silence. The nurse, dark-faced and faithful, drew back. Carlotta\nglanced at her children; but more helplessly, she gazed at him.\n\n\"Bonny children! Bonny boys, aren't they, nurse?\" I said softly.\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" she said quickly. \"They are!\"\n\n\"Ever think I'd have twins, roistering twins?\" said Carlotta, looking at me.\n\n\"I never did,\" said I.\n\n\"Ask Luke whether it's bad luck or bad management,\" she said, with that schoolgirl's snirt of laughter, looking up apprehensively\nat her husband.\n\n\"Oh, I!\" he said, turning suddenly and speaking loud, in his wounded voice. \"I call it amazing good luck, myself! Don't know what\nother people think about it.\" Yet he had the fine, wincing fear in his body, of an injured dog.\n\nAfter that, for years I did not see her again. I heard she had a baby girl. Then a catastrophe happened: both the twins were\nkilled in a motor-car accident in America, motoring with their aunt.\n\nI learned the news late, and did not write to Carlotta. What could I say?\n\nA few months later, crowning disaster, the baby girl died of some sudden illness. The Lathkill ill-luck seemed to be working\nsurely.\n\nPoor Carlotta! I had no further news of her, only I heard that she and Lord Lathkill were both living in seclusion, with his\nmother, at the place in Derbyshire.\n\nWhen circumstances brought me to England, I debated within myself, whether I should write or not to Carlotta. At last I sent a\nnote to the London address.\n\nI had a reply from the country: \"So glad you are within reach again! When will you come and see us?\"\n\nI was not very keen on going to Riddings. After all, it was Lord Lathkill's place, and Lady Lathkill, his mother, was old and of\nthe old school. And I always something of a sansculotte, who will only be king when breeches are off.\n\n\"Come to town,\" I wrote, \"and let us have lunch together.\"\n\nShe came. She looked older, and pain had drawn horizontal lines across her face.\n\n\"You're not a bit different,\" she said to me.\n\n\"And you're only a little bit,\" I said.\n\n\"Am I!\" she replied, in a deadened, melancholic voice. \"Perhaps! I suppose while we live we've got to live. What do you think?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think it. To be the living dead, that's awful.\"\n\n\"Quite!\" she said, with terrible finality.\n\n\"How is Lord Lathkill?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh,\" she said. \"It's finished him, as far as living is concerned. But he's very willing for me to live.\"\n\n\"And you, are you willing?\" I said.\n\nShe looked up into my eyes, strangely.\n\n\"I'm not sure,\" she said. \"I need help. What do you think about it?\"\n\n\"Oh God, live if you can!\"\n\n\"Even take help?\" she said, with her strange involved simplicity.\n\n\"Ah, certainly!\"\n\n\"Would you recommend it?\"\n\n\"Why, yes! You are a young thing——\" I began.\n\n\"Won't you come down to Riddings?\" she said quickly.\n\n\"And Lord Lathkill—and his mother?\" I asked.\n\n\"They want you.\"\n\n\"Do you want me to come?\"\n\n\"I want you to, yes! Will you?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, if you want me.\"\n\n\"When, then?\"\n\n\"When you wish.\"\n\n\"Do you mean it?\"\n\n\"Why, of course.\"\n\n\"You're not afraid of the Lathkill ill-luck?\"\n\n\"I!\" I exclaimed in amazement; such amazement, that she gave her schoolgirl snirt of laughter.\n\n\"Very well, then,\" she said. \"Monday? Does that suit you?\"\n\nWe made arrangements, and I saw her off at the station.\n\nI knew Riddings, Lord Lathkill's place, from the outside. It was an old Derbyshire stone house, at the end of the village of\nMiddleton: a house with three sharp gables, set back not very far from the high road, but with a gloomy moor for a park behind.\n\nMonday was a dark day over the Derbyshire hills. The green hills were dark, dark green, the stone fences seemed almost black. Even\nthe little railway-station, deep in the green, cleft hollow, was of stone, and dark and cold, and seemed in the underworld.\n\nLord Lathkill was at the station. He was wearing spectacles, and his brown eyes stared strangely. His black hair fell lank over\nhis forehead.\n\n\"I'm so awfully glad you've come,\" he said. \"It is cheering Carlotta up immensely.\"\n\nMe, as a man myself, he hardly seemed to notice. I was something which had arrived, and was expected. Otherwise he had an odd,\nunnatural briskness of manner.\n\n\"I hope I shan't disturb your mother. Lady Lathkill,\" I said as he tucked me up in the car.\n\n\"On the contrary,\" he sang, in his slow voice, \"she is looking forward to your coming as much as we both are. Oh, no, don't look\non Mother as too old-fashioned, she's not so at all. She's tremendously up-to-date in art and literature and that kind of thing.\nShe has her leaning towards the uncanny—spiritualism, and that kind of thing—nowadays, but Carlotta and I think that if it gives\nher an interest, all well and good.\"\n\nHe tucked me up most carefully in the rugs, and the servant put a footwarmer at my feet.\n\n\"Derbyshire, you know, is a cold county,\" continued Lord Lathkill, \"especially among the hills.\"\n\n\"It's a very dark county,\" I said.\n\n\"Yes, I suppose it is, to one coming from the tropics. We, of course, don't notice it; we rather like it.\"\n\nHe seemed curiously smaller, shrunken, and his rather long cheeks were sallow. His manner, however, was much more cheerful, almost\ncommunicative. But he talked, as it were, to the faceless air, not really to me. I wasn't really there at all. He was talking to\nhimself. And when once he looked at me, his brown eyes had a hollow look, like gaps with nothing in them except a haggard, hollow\nfear. He was gazing through the windows of nothingness, to see if I were really there.\n\nIt was dark when we got to Riddings. The house had no door in the front, and only two windows upstairs were lit. It did not seem\nvery hospitable. We entered at the side, and a very silent manservant took my things.\n\nWe went upstairs in silence, in the dead-seeming house. Carlotta had heard us, and was at the top of the stairs. She was already\ndressed; her long white arms were bare; she had something glittering on a dull green dress.\n\n\"I was so afraid you wouldn't come,\" she said, in a dulled voice, as she gave me her hand. She seemed as if she would begin to\ncry. But of course she wouldn't. The corridor, dark-panelled and with blue carpet on the floor, receded dimly, with a certain\ndreary gloom. A servant was diminishing in the distance, with my bags, silently. There was a curious, unpleasant sense of the\nfixity of the materials of the house, the obscene triumph of dead Matter. Yet the place was warm, central-heated.\n\nCarlotta pulled herself together, and said, dulled:\n\n\"Would you care to speak to my mother-in-law before you go to your room? She would like it.\"\n\nWe entered a small drawing-room, abruptly. I saw the water-colours on the walls and a white-haired lady in black bending round to\nlook at the door as she rose, cautiously.\n\n\"This is Mr. Morier, Mother-in-law,\" said Carlotta, in her dull, rather quick way, \"on his way to his room.\"\n\nThe dowager Lady Lathkill came a few steps forward, leaning from heavy hips, and gave me her hand. Her crest of hair was snow\nwhite, and she had curious blue eyes, fixed, with a tiny dot of a pupil, peering from her pink, soft-skinned face of an old and\nwell-preserved woman. She wore a lace fichu. The upper part of her body was moderately slim, leaning forward slightly from her\nheavy black-silk hips.\n\nShe murmured something to me, staring at me fixedly for a long time, but as a bird does, with shrewd, cold, far-distant sight. As\na hawk, perhaps, looks shrewdly far down, in his search. Then, muttering, she presented to me the other two people in the room: a\ntall, short-faced, swarthy young woman with the hint of a black moustache; and a plump man in a dinner-jacket, rather bald and\nruddy, with a little grey moustache, but yellow under the eyes. He was Colonel Hale.\n\nThey all seemed awkward, as if I had interrupted them at a séance. I didn't know what to say: they were utter strangers to me.\n\n\"Better come and choose your room, then,\" said Carlotta, and I bowed dumbly, following her out of the room. The old Lady Lathkill\nstill stood planted on her heavy hips, looking half round after us with her ferret's blue eyes. She had hardly any eyebrows, but\nthey were arched high up on her pink, soft forehead, under the crest of icily white hair. She had never emerged for a second from\nthe remote place where she unyieldingly kept herself.\n\nCarlotta, Lord Lathkill and I tramped in silence down the corridor and round a bend. We could none of us get a word out. As he\nsuddenly, rather violently flung open a door at the end of the wing, he said, turning round to me with a resentful, hangdog air:\n\n\"We did you the honour of offering you our ghost room. It doesn't look much, but it's our equivalent for a royal apartment.\"\n\nIt was a good-sized room with faded, red-painted panelling showing remains of gilt, and the usual big, old mahogany furniture, and\na big pinky-faded carpet with big, whitish, faded roses. A bright fire was burning in the stone fireplace.\n\n\"Why?\" said I, looking at the stretches of the faded, once handsome carpet.\n\n\"Why what?\" said Lord Lathkill. \"Why did we offer you this room?\"\n\n\"Yes! No! Why is it your equivalent for a royal apartment?\"\n\n\"Oh, because our ghost is as rare as sovereignty in her visits, and twice as welcome. Her gifts are infinitely more worth having.\"\n\n\"What sort of gifts?\"\n\n\"The family fortune. She invariably restores the family fortune. That's why we put you here, to tempt her.\"\n\n\"What temptation should I be?—especially to restoring your family fortunes. I didn't think they needed it, anyhow.\"\n\n\"Well!\" he hesitated. \"Not exactly in money: we can manage modestly that way; but in everything else but money——\"\n\nThere was a pause. I was thinking of Carlotta's \"luck for two.\" Poor Carlotta! She looked worn now. Especially her chin looked\nworn, showing the edge of the jaw. She had sat herself down in a chair by the fire, and put her feet on the stone fender, and was\nleaning forward, screening her face with her hand, still careful of her complexion. I could see her broad, white shoulders,\nshowing the shoulder-blades, as she leaned forward, beneath her dress. But it was as if some bitterness had soaked all the life\nout of her, and she was only weary, or inert, drained of her feelings. It grieved me, and the thought passed through my mind that\na man should take her in his arms and cherish her body, and start her flame again. If she would let him, which was doubtful.\n\nHer courage was fallen, in her body; only her spirit fought on. She would have to restore the body of her life, and only a living\nbody could do it.\n\n\"What about your ghost?\" I said to him. \"Is she really ghastly?\"\n\n\"Not at all!\" he said. \"She's supposed to be lovely. But I have no experience, and I don't know anybody who has. We hoped you'd\ncome, though, and tempt her. Mother had a message about you, you know.\"\n\n\"No, I didn't know.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! When you were still in Africa. The medium said: 'There is a man in Africa. I can only see M, a double M. He is thinking\nof your family. It would be good if he entered your family.' Mother was awfully puzzled, but Carlotta said 'Mark Morier' at once.\"\n\n\"That's not why I asked you down,\" said Carlotta quickly, looking round, shading her eyes with her hand as she looked at me.\n\nI laughed, saying nothing.\n\n\"But, of course,\" continued Lord Lathkill, \"you needn't have this room. We have another one ready as well. Would you like to see\nit?\"\n\n\"How does your ghost manifest herself?\" I said, parrying.\n\n\"Well, I hardly know. She seems to be a very grateful presence, and that's about all I do know. She was apparently quite persona\ngrata to everyone she visited. Gratissima, apparently!\"\n\n\"Benissimo!\" said I.\n\nA servant appeared in the doorway, murmuring something I could not hear. Everybody in the house, except Carlotta and Lord\nLathkill, seemed to murmur under their breath.\n\n\"What's she say?\" I asked.\n\n\"If you will stay in this room? I told her you might like a room on the front. And if you'll take a bath?\" said Carlotta.\n\n\"Yes!\" said I. And Carlotta repeated to the maid-servant.\n\n\"And for heaven's sake speak to me loudly,\" said I to that elderly correct female in her starched collar, in the doorway.\n\n\"Very good, sir!\" she piped up. \"And shall I make the bath hot, or medium?\"\n\n\"Hot!\" said I, like a cannon-shot.\n\n\"Very good, sir!\" she piped up again, and her elderly eyes twinkled as she turned and disappeared.\n\nCarlotta laughed, and I sighed.\n\nWe were six at table. The pink Colonel with the yellow creases under his blue eyes sat opposite me, like an old boy with a liver.\nNext him sat Lady Lathkill, watching from her distance. Her pink, soft old face, naked-seeming, with its pin-point blue eyes, was\na real modern witch-face.\n\nNext me, on my left, was the dark young woman, whose slim, swarthy arms had an indiscernible down on them. She had a blackish\nneck, and her expressionless yellow-brown eyes said nothing, under level black brows. She was inaccessible. I made some remarks,\nwithout result. Then I said:\n\n\"I didn't hear your name when Lady Lathkill introduced me to you.\"\n\nHer yellow-brown eyes stared into mine for some moments before she said:\n\n\"Mrs. Hale!\" Then she glanced across the table. \"Colonel Hale is my husband.\"\n\nMy face must have signalled my surprise. She stared into my eyes very curiously, with a significance I could not grasp, a long,\nhard stare. I looked at the bald, pink head of the Colonel bent over his soup, and I returned to my own soup.\n\n\"Did you have a good time in London?\" said Carlotta.\n\n\"No,\" said I. \"It was dismal.\"\n\n\"Not a good word to say for it?\"\n\n\"Not one.\"\n\n\"No nice people?\"\n\n\"Not my sort of nice.\"\n\n\"What's your sort of nice?\" she asked, with a little laugh.\n\nThe other people were stone. It was like talking into a chasm.\n\n\"Ah! If I knew myself, I'd look for them! But not sentimental, with a lot of soppy emotions on top, and nasty ones underneath.\"\n\n\"Who are you thinking of?\" Carlotta looked up at me as the man brought the fish. She had a crushed sort of roguishness. The other\ndiners were images.\n\n\"I? Nobody. Just everybody. No, I think I was thinking of the Obelisk Memorial Service.\"\n\n\"Did you go to it?\"\n\n\"No, but I fell into it.\"\n\n\"Wasn't it moving?\"\n\n\"Rhubarb, senna, that kind of moving!\"\n\nShe gave a little laugh, looking up into my face, from the fish.\n\n\"What was wrong with it?\"\n\nI noticed that the Colonel and Lady Lathkill each had a little dish of rice, no fish, and that they were served second—oh,\nhumility!—and that neither took the white wine. No, they had no wine-glasses. The remoteness gathered about them, like the snows\non Everest. The dowager peered across at me occasionally, like a white ermine out of the snow, and she had that cold air about\nher, of being good, and containing a secret of goodness: remotely, ponderously, fixedly knowing better. And I, with my chatter,\nwas one of those fabulous fleas that are said to hop upon glaciers.\n\n\"Wrong with it? It was wrong, all wrong. In the rain, a soppy crowd, with soppy bare heads, soppy emotions, soppy chrysanthemums\nand prickly laurestinus! A steam of wet mob-emotions! Ah, no, it shouldn't be allowed.\"\n\nCarlotta's face had fallen. She again could feel death in her bowels, the kind of death the war signifies.\n\n\"Wouldn't you have us honour the dead?\" came Lady Lathkill's secretive voice across at me, as if a white ermine had barked.\n\n\"Honour the dead!\" My mind opened in amazement. \"Do you think they'd be honoured?\"\n\nI put the question in all sincerity.\n\n\"They would understand the intention was to honour them,\" came her reply.\n\nI felt astounded.\n\n\"If I were dead, would I be honoured if a great, steamy wet crowd came after me with soppy chrysanthemums and prickly laurestinus?\nUgh! I'd run to the nethermost ends of Hades. Lord, how I'd run from them!\"\n\nThe manservant gave us roast mutton, and Lady Lathkill and the Colonel chestnuts in sauce. Then he poured the burgundy. It was\ngood wine. The pseudo-conversation was interrupted.\n\nLady Lathkill ate in silence, like an ermine in the snow, feeding on his prey. Sometimes she looked round the table, her blue eyes\npeering fixedly, completely uncommunicative. She was very watchful to see that we were all properly attended to; \"The currant\njelly for Mr. Morier,\" she would murmur, as if it were her table. Lord Lathkill, next her, ate in complete absence. Sometimes she\nmurmured to him, and he murmured back, but I never could hear what they said. The Colonel swallowed the chestnuts in dejection, as\nif all were weary duty to him now. I put it down to his liver.\n\nIt was an awful dinner-party. I never could hear a word anybody said, except Carlotta. They all let their words die in their\nthroats, as if the larynx were the coffin of sound.\n\nCarlotta tried to keep her end up, the cheerful hostess sort of thing. But Lady Lathkill somehow, in silence and apparent\nhumility, had stolen the authority that goes with the hostess, and she hung on to it grimly, like a white ermine sucking a rabbit.\nCarlotta kept glancing miserably at me, to see what I thought. I didn't think anything. I just felt frozen within the tomb. And I\ndrank the good, good warm burgundy.\n\n\"Mr. Morier's glass!\" murmured Lady Lathkill, and her blue eyes with their black pin-points rested on mine a moment.\n\n\"Awfully nice to drink good burgundy!\" said I pleasantly.\n\nShe bowed her head slightly, and murmured something inaudible.\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\"\n\n\"Very glad you like it!\" she repeated, with distaste at having to say it again, out loud.\n\n\"Yes, I do. It's good.\"\n\nMrs. Hale, who had sat tall and erect and alert, like a black she-fox, never making a sound, looked round at me to see what sort\nof specimen I was. She was just a bit intrigued.\n\n\"Yes, thanks,\" came a musical murmur from Lord Lathkill. \"I think I will take some more.\"\n\nThe man, who had hesitated, filled his glass.\n\n\"I'm awfully sorry I can't drink wine,\" said Carlotta, absently. \"It has the wrong effect on me.\"\n\n\"I should say it has the wrong effect on everybody,\" said the Colonel, with an uneasy attempt to be there. \"But some people like\nthe effect, and some don't.\"\n\nI looked at him in wonder. Why was he chipping in? He looked as if he'd liked the effect well enough, in his day.\n\n\"Oh, no!\" retorted Carlotta coldly. \"The effect on different people is quite different.\"\n\nShe closed with finality, and a further frost fell on the table.\n\n\"Quite so,\" began the Colonel, trying, since he'd gone off the deep end, to keep afloat.\n\nBut Carlotta turned abruptly to me.\n\n\"Why is it, do you think, that the effect is so different on different people?\"\n\n\"And on different occasions,\" said I, grinning through my burgundy. \"Do you know what they say? They say that alcohol, if it has\nan effect on your psyche, takes you back to old states of consciousness, and old reactions. But some people it doesn't stimulate\nat all, there is only a nervous reaction of repulsion.\"\n\n\"There's certainly a nervous reaction of repulsion in me,\" said Carlotta.\n\n\"As there is in all higher natures,\" murmured Lady Lathkill.\n\n\"Dogs hate whisky,\" said I.\n\n\"That's quite right,\" said the Colonel. \"Scared of it!\"\n\n\"I've often thought,\" said I, \"about those old states of consciousness. It's supposed to be an awful retrogression, reverting back\nto them. Myself, my desire to go onwards takes me back a little.\"\n\n\"Where to?\" said Carlotta.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know! To where you feel a bit warm, and like smashing the glasses, don't you know?\n\nJ'avons bien bu et nous boirons!Cassons les verres nous les payerons!Compagnons! Voyez vous bien!Voyez vous bien!Voyez! voyez!\nvoyez vous bienQue les d'moiselles sont bellesOù nous allons!\"\n\nI had the effrontery to sing this verse of an old soldiers' song while Lady Lathkill was finishing her celery and nut salad. I\nsang it quite nicely, in a natty, well-balanced little voice, smiling all over my face meanwhile. The servant, as he went round\nfor Lady Lathkill's plate, furtively fetched a look at me. Look! thought I. You chicken that's come untrussed!\n\nThe partridges had gone, we had swallowed the flan, and were at dessert. They had accepted my song in complete silence. Even\nCarlotta! My flan had gone down in one gulp, like an oyster.\n\n\"You're quite right!\" said Lord Lathkill, amid the squashing of walnuts. \"I mean the state of mind of a Viking, shall we say, or\nof a Cataline conspirator, might be frightfully good for us, if we could re-capture it.\"\n\n\"A Viking!\" said I, stupefied. And Carlotta gave a wild snirt of laughter.\n\n\"Why not a Viking?\" he asked in all innocence.\n\n\"A Viking!\" I repeated, and swallowed my port. Then I looked round at my black-browed neighbour.\n\n\"Why do you never say anything?\" I asked.\n\n\"What should I say?\" she replied, frightened at the thought.\n\nI was finished. I gazed into my port as if expecting the ultimate revelation.\n\nLady Lathkill rustled her finger-tips in the finger-bowl, and laid down her napkin decisively. The Colonel, old buck, rose at once\nto draw back her chair. Place aux hommes! I bowed to my neighbour, Mrs. Hale, a most disconcerting bow, and she made a circuit to\nget by me.\n\n\"You won't be awfully long?\" said Carlotta, looking at me with her slow, hazel-green eyes, between mischief and wistfulness and\nutter depression.\n\nLady Lathkill steered heavily past me as if I didn't exist, perching rather forward, with her crest of white hair, from her big\nhips. She seemed abstracted, concentrated on something, as she went.\n\nI closed the door, and turned to the men.\n\n\"Dans la première aubergeJ'eus b'en bu!\"\n\nsang I in a little voice.\n\n\"Quite right,\" said Lord Lathkill. \"You're quite right.\"\n\nAnd we sent the port round.\n\n\"This house,\" I said, \"needs a sort of Spring cleaning.\"\n\n\"You're quite right,\" said Lord Lathkill.\n\n\"There's a bit of a dead smell!\" said I. \"We need Bacchus, and Eros, to sweeten it up, to freshen it.\"\n\n\"You think Bacchus and Eros?\" said Lord Lathkill, with complete seriousness; as if one might have telephoned for them.\n\n\"In the best sense,\" said I. As if we were going to get them from Fortnum and Mason's, at least.\n\n\"What exactly is the best sense?\" asked Lord Lathkill.\n\n\"Ah! The flame of life! There's a dead smell here.\"\n\nThe Colonel fingered his glass with thick, inert fingers, uneasily.\n\n\"Do you think so?\" he said, looking up at me heavily.\n\n\"Don't you?\"\n\nHe gazed at me with blank, glazed blue eyes, that had deathly yellow stains underneath. Something was wrong with him, some sort of\nbreakdown. He should have been a fat, healthy, jolly old boy. Not very old either: probably not quite sixty. But with this\ncollapse on him, he seemed, somehow, to smell.\n\n\"You know,\" he said, staring at me with a sort of gruesome challenge, then looking down at his wine, \"there's more things than\nwe're aware of, happening to us!\" He looked up at me again, shutting his full lips under his little grey moustache, and gazing\nwith a glazed defiance.\n\n\"Quite!\" said I.\n\nHe continued to gaze at me with glazed, gruesome defiance.\n\n\"Ha!\" He made a sudden movement, and seemed to break up, collapse and become brokenly natural. \"There, you've said it. I married\nmy wife when I was a kid of twenty.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Hale?\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Not this one\"—he jerked his head towards the door—\"my first wife.\" There was a pause; he looked at me with shamed eyes, then\nturned his wine-glass round and his head dropped. Staring at his twisting glass, he continued: \"I married her when I was twenty,\nand she was twenty-eight. You might say, she married me. Well, there it was! We had three children—I've got three married\ndaughters—and we got on all right. I suppose she mothered me, in a way. And I never thought a thing. I was content enough, wasn't\ntied to her apron strings, and she never asked questions. She was always fond of me, and I took it for granted. I took it for\ngranted. Even when she died—I was away in Salonika—I took it for granted, if you understand me. It was part of the rest of\nthings—war—life—death. I knew I should feel lonely when I got back. Well, then I got buried—shell dropped, and the dug-out caved\nin—and that queered me. They sent me home. And the minute I saw the Lizard light—it was evening when we got up out of the Bay—I\nrealised that Lucy had been waiting for me. I could feel her there, at my side, more plainly than I feel you now. And do you know,\nat that moment I woke up to her, and she made an awful impression on me. She seemed, if you get me, tremendously powerful,\nimportant; everything else dwindled away. There was the Lizard light blinking a long way off, and that meant home. And all the\nrest was my wife, Lucy: as if her skirts filled all the darkness. In a way, I was frightened; but that was because I couldn't\nquite get myself into line. I felt: Good God! I never knew her! And she was this tremendous thing! I felt like a child, and as\nweak as a kitten. And, believe me or not, from that day to this she's never left me. I know quite well she can hear what I'm\nsaying. But she'll let me tell you. I knew that at dinner-time.\"\n\n\"But what made you marry again?\" I said.\n\n\"She made me!\" He went a trifle yellow on his cheek-bones. \"I could feel her telling me, 'Marry! Marry!' Lady Lathkill had\nmessages from her too; she was her great friend in life. I didn't think of marrying. But Lady Lathkill had the same message, that\nI must marry. Then a medium described the girl, in detail: my present wife. I knew her at once, friend of my daughters. After that\nthe messages became more insistent, waking me three and four times in the night. Lady Lathkill urged me to propose, and I did it,\nand was accepted. My present wife was just twenty-eight, the age Lucy had been——\"\n\n\"How long ago did you marry the present Mrs. Hale?\"\n\n\"A little over a year ago. Well, I thought I had done what was required of me. But directly after the wedding, such a state of\nterror came over me—perfectly unreasonable—I became almost unconscious. My present wife asked the if I was ill, and I said I was.\nWe got to Paris. I felt I was dying. But I said I was going out to see a doctor, and I found myself kneeling in a church. Then I\nfound peace—and Lucy. She had her arms round me, and I was like a child at peace. I must have knelt there for a couple of hours,\nin Lucy's arms. I never felt like that when I was alive: why, I couldn't stand that sort of thing! It's all come on\nafter—after——And now, I daren't offend Lucy's spirit. If I do, I suffer tortures till I've made peace again, till she folds me in\nher arms. Then I can live. But she won't let me go near the present Mrs. Hale. I—I—I daren't go near her.\"\n\nHe looked up at me with fear, and shame, and shameful secrecy, and a sort of gloating showing in his unmanned blue eyes. He had\nbeen talking as if in his sleep.\n\n\"Why did your dead wife urge you to marry again?\" I said.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he replied. \"I don't know. She was older than I was, and all the cleverness was on her side. She was a very clever\nwoman, and I was never much in the intellectual line, myself. I just took it for granted she liked me. She never showed jealousy,\nbut I think now, perhaps she was jealous all the time, and kept it under. I don't know. I think she never felt quite straight\nabout having married me. It seems like that. As if she had something on her mind. Do you know, while she was alive, I never gave\nit a thought. And now I'm aware of nothing else but her. It's as if her spirit wanted to live in my body, or at any rate—I don't\nknow——\"\n\nHis blue eyes were glazed, almost fishy, with fear and gloating shame. He had a short nose, and full, self-indulgent lips, and a\nonce-comely chin. Eternally a careless boy of thirteen. But now, care had got him in decay.\n\n\"And what does your present wife say?\" I asked.\n\nHe poured himself some more wine.\n\n\"Why,\" he replied, \"except for her, I shouldn't mind so much. She says nothing. Lady Lathkill has explained everything to her, and\nshe agrees that—that—a spirit from the other side is more important than mere pleasure—you know what I mean. Lady Lathkill says\nthat this is a preparation for my next incarnation, when I am going to serve Woman, and help Her to take Her place.\"\n\nHe looked up again, trying to be proud in his shame.\n\n\"Well, what a damned curious story!\" exclaimed Lord Lathkill. \"Mother's idea for herself—she had it in a message too—is that she\nis coming on earth the next time to save the animals from the cruelty of man. That's why she hates meat at table, or anything that\nhas to be killed.\"\n\n\"And does Lady Lathkill encourage you in this business with your dead wife?\" said I.\n\n\"Yes. She helps me. When I get as you might say at cross purposes with Lucy—with Lucy's spirit, that is—Lady Lathkill helps to put\nit right between us. Then I'm all right, when I know I'm loved.\"\n\nHe looked at me stealthily, cunningly.\n\n\"Then you're all wrong,\" said I, \"surely.\"\n\n\"And do you mean to say,\" put in Lord Lathkill, \"that you don't live with the present Mrs. Hale at all? Do you mean to say you\nnever have lived with her?\"\n\n\"I've got a higher claim on me,\" said the unhappy Colonel.\n\n\"My God!\" said Lord Lathkill.\n\nI looked in amazement: the sort of chap who picks up a woman and has a good time with her for a week, then goes home as nice as\npie, and now look at him! It was obvious that he had a terror of his black-browed new wife, as well as of Lucy's spirit. A devil\nand a deep sea with a vengeance!\n\n\"A damned curious story!\" mused Lord Lathkill. \"I'm not so sure I like it. Something's wrong somewhere. We shall have to go\nupstairs.\"\n\n\"Wrong!\" said I. \"Why, Colonel, don't you turn round and quarrel with the spirit of your first wife, fatally and finally, and get\nrid of her?\"\n\nThe Colonel looked at me, still diminished and afraid, but perking up a bit, as we rose from table.\n\n\"How would you go about it?\" he said.\n\n\"I'd just face her, wherever she seemed to be, and say: 'Lucy, go to Blazes!'\"\n\nLord Lathkill burst into a loud laugh, then was suddenly silent as the door noiselessly opened, and the dowager's white hair and\npointed uncanny eyes peered in, then entered.\n\n\"I think I left my papers in here, Luke,\" she murmured.\n\n\"Yes, mother. There they are. We're just coming up.\"\n\n\"Take your time.\"\n\nHe held the door, and ducking forward, she went out again, clutching some papers. The Colonel had blenched yellow on his\ncheek-bones.\n\nWe went upstairs to the small drawing-room.\n\n\"You were a long time,\" said Carlotta, looking in all our faces. \"Hope the coffee's not cold. We'll have fresh if it is.\"\n\nShe poured out, and Mrs. Hale carried the cups. The dark young woman thrust out her straight, dusky arm, offering me sugar, and\ngazing at me with her unchanging, yellow-brown eyes. I looked back at her, and being clairvoyant in this house, was conscious of\nthe curves of her erect body, the sparse black hairs there would be on her strong-skinned dusky thighs. She was a woman of thirty,\nand she had had a great dread, lest she should never marry. Now she was as if mesmerised.\n\n\"What do you do usually in the evenings?\" I said.\n\nShe turned to me as if startled, as she nearly always did when addressed.\n\n\"We do nothing,\" she replied. \"Talk; and sometimes Lady Lathkill reads.\"\n\n\"What does she read?\"\n\n\"About spiritualism.\"\n\n\"Sounds pretty dull.\"\n\nShe looked at me again, but she did not answer. It was difficult to get anything out of her. She put up no fight, only remained in\nthe same swarthy, passive, negative resistance. For a moment I wondered that no men made love to her: it was obvious they didn't.\nBut then, modern young men are accustomed to being attracted, flattered, impressed: they expect an effort to please. And Mrs. Hale\nmade none: didn't know how. Which for me was her mystery. She was passive, static, locked up in a resistant passivity that had\nfire beneath it.\n\nLord Lathkill came and sat by us. The Colonel's confession had had an effect on him.\n\n\"I'm afraid,\" he said to Mrs. Hale, \"you have a thin time here.\"\n\n\"Why?\" she asked.\n\n\"Oh, there is so little to amuse you. Do you like to dance?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said.\n\n\"Well, then,\" he said, \"let us go downstairs and dance to the Victrola. There are four of us. You'll come, of course?\" he said to\nme.\n\nThen he turned to his mother.\n\n\"Mother, we shall go down to the morning-room and dance. Will you come too? Will you. Colonel?\"\n\nThe dowager gazed at her son.\n\n\"I will come and look on,\" she said.\n\n\"And I will play the pianola, if you like,\" volunteered the Colonel.\n\nWe went down, and pushed aside the chintz chairs and the rugs. Lady Lathkill sat in a chair, the Colonel worked away at the\npianola. I danced with Carlotta, Lord Lathkill with Mrs. Hale.\n\nA quiet soothing came over me, dancing with Carlotta. She was very still and remote, and she hardly looked at me. Yet the touch of\nher was wonderful, like a flower that yields itself to the morning. Her warm, silken shoulder was soft and grateful under my hand,\nas if it knew me with that second knowledge which is part of one's childhood, and which so rarely blossoms again in manhood and\nwomanhood. It was as if we had known each other perfectly, as children, and now, as man and woman, met in the full, further\nsympathy. Perhaps, in modern people, only after long suffering and defeat, can the naked intuition break free between woman and\nman.\n\nShe, I knew, let the strain and the tension of all her life depart from her then, leaving her nakedly still, within my arm. And I\nonly wanted to be with her, to have her in my touch.\n\nYet after the second dance she looked at me, and suggested that she should dance with her husband. So I found myself with the\nstrong, passive shoulder of Mrs. Hale under my hand, and her inert hand in mine, as I looked down at her dusky, dirty-looking\nneck—she wisely avoided powder. The duskiness of her mesmerised body made me see the faint dark sheen of her thighs, with\nintermittent black hairs. It was as if they shone through the silk of her mauve dress, like the limbs of a half-wild animal, that\nis locked up in its own helpless dumb winter, a prisoner.\n\nShe knew, with the heavy intuition of her sort, that I glimpsed her crude among the bushes, and felt her attraction. But she kept\nlooking away over my shoulder, with her yellow eyes, towards Lord Lathkill.\n\nMyself or him, it was a question of which got there first. But she preferred him. Only for some things she would rather it were\nme.\n\nLuke had changed curiously. His body seemed to have come alive, in the dark cloth of his evening suit; his eyes had a\ndevil-may-care light in them, his long cheeks a touch of scarlet, and his black hair felt loose over his forehead. He had again\nsome of that Guardsman's sense of well-being and claim to the best in life, which I had noticed the first time I saw him. But now\nit was a little more florid, defiant, with a touch of madness.\n\nHe looked down at Carlotta with uncanny kindness and affection. Yet he was glad to hand her over to me. He, too, was afraid of\nher: as if with her his bad luck had worked. Whereas, in a throb of crude brutality, he felt it would not work with the dark young\nwoman. So, he handed Carlotta over to me with relief, as if, with me, she would be safe from the doom of his bad luck. And he,\nwith the other woman, would be safe from it too. For the other woman was outside the circle.\n\nI was glad to have Carlotta again: to have that inexpressible delicate and complete quiet of the two of us, resting my heart in a\nbalance now at last physical as well as spiritual. Till now, it had always been a fragmentary thing. Now, for this hour at least,\nit was whole, a soft, complete, physical flow, and a unison deeper even than childhood.\n\nAs she danced she shivered slightly, and I seemed to smell frost in the air. The Colonel, too, was not keeping the rhythm.\n\n\"Has it turned colder?\" I said.\n\n\"I wonder!\" she answered, looking up at me with a slow beseeching. Why, and for what was she beseeching me? I pressed my hand a\nlittle closer, and her small breasts seemed to speak to me. The Colonel recovered the rhythm again.\n\nBut at the end of the dance she shivered again, and it seemed to me I too was chilled.\n\n\"Has it suddenly turned colder?\" I said, going to the radiator. It was quite hot.\n\n\"It seems to me it has,\" said Lord Lathkill, in a queer voice.\n\nThe Colonel was sitting abjectly on the music stool, as if broken.\n\n\"Shall we have another? Shall we try a tango?\" said Lord Lathkill. \"As much of it as we can manage?\"\n\n\"I—I——\" the Colonel began, turning round on the seat, his face yellow. \"I'm not sure——\"\n\nCarlotta shivered. The frost seemed to touch my vitals. Mrs. Hale stood stiff, like a pillar of brown rock-salt, staring at her\nhusband.\n\n\"We had better leave off,\" murmured Lady Lathkill, rising.\n\nThen she did an extraordinary thing. She lifted her face, staring to the other side, and said suddenly, in a clear, cruel sort of\nvoice:\n\n\"Are you here, Lucy?\"\n\nShe was speaking across to the spirits. Deep inside me leaped a jump of laughter. I wanted to howl with laughter. Then instantly,\nI went inert again. The chill gloom seemed to deepen suddenly in the room, everybody was overcome. On the piano-seat the Colonel\nsat yellow and huddled, with a terrible hang-dog look of guilt on his face. There was a silence, in which the cold seemed to\ncreak. Then came again the peculiar bell-like ringing of Lady Lath kill's voice:\n\n\"Are you here? What do you wish us to do?\"\n\nA dead and ghastly silence, in which we all remained transfixed. Then from somewhere came two slow thuds, and a sound of drapery\nmoving. The Colonel, with mad fear in his eyes, looked round at the uncurtained windows, and crouched on his seat.\n\n\"We must leave this room,\" said Lady Lathkill.\n\n\"I'll tell you what. Mother,\" said Lord Lathkill curiously; \"you and the Colonel go up, and we'll just turn on the Victrola.\"\n\nThat was almost uncanny of him. For myself, the cold effluence of these people had paralysed me. Now I began to rally. I felt that\nLord Lathkill was sane, it was these other people who were mad.\n\nAgain from somewhere indefinite came two slow thuds.\n\n\"We must leave this room,\" repeated Lady Lathkill in monotony.\n\n\"All right. Mother. You go. I'll just turn on the Victrola.\"\n\nAnd Lord Lathkill strode across the room. In another moment the monstrous barking howl of the opening of a jazz tune, an event far\nmore extraordinary than thuds, poured from the unmoving bit of furniture called a Victrola.\n\nLady Lathkill silently departed. The Colonel got to his feet.\n\n\"I wouldn't go if I were you. Colonel,\" said I. \"Why not dance? I'll look on this time.\"\n\nI felt as if I were resisting a rushing, cold dark current.\n\nLord Lathkill was already dancing with Mrs. Hale, skating delicately along, with a certain smile of obstinacy, secrecy, and\nexcitement kindled on his face. Carlotta went up quietly to the Colonel, and put her hand on his broad shoulder. He let himself be\nmoved into the dance, but he had no heart in it.\n\nThere came a heavy crash, out of the distance. The Colonel stopped as if shot: in another moment he would go down on his knees.\nAnd his face was terrible. It was obvious he really felt another presence, other than ours, blotting us out. The room seemed dree\nand cold. It was heavy work, bearing up.\n\nThe Colonel's lips were moving, but no sound came forth. Then, absolutely oblivious of us, he went out of the room.\n\nThe Victrola had run down. Lord Lathkill went to wind it up again, saying:\n\n\"I suppose mother knocked over a piece of furniture.\"\n\nBut we were all of us depressed, in abject depression.\n\n\"Isn't it awful!\" Carlotta said to me, looking up beseechingly.\n\n\"Abominable!\" said I.\n\n\"What do you think there is in it?\"\n\n\"God knows. The only thing is to stop it, as one does hysteria. It's on a par with hysteria.\"\n\n\"Quite,\" she said.\n\nLord Lathkill was dancing, and smiling very curiously down into his partner's face. The Victrola was at its loudest.\n\nCarlotta and I looked at one another, with hardly the heart to start again. The house felt hollow and gruesome. One wanted to get\nout, to get away from the cold, uncanny blight which filled the air.\n\n\"Oh, I say, keep the ball rolling,\" called Lord Lathkill.\n\n\"Come,\" I said to Carlotta.\n\nEven then she hung back a little. If she had not suffered, and lost so much, she would have gone upstairs at once to struggle in\nthe silent wrestling of wills with her mother-in-law. Even now, that particular fight drew her, almost the strongest. But I took\nher hand.\n\n\"Come,\" I said. \"Let us dance it down. We'll roll the ball the opposite way.\"\n\nShe danced with me, but she was absent, unwilling. The empty gloom of the house, the sense of cold, and of deadening opposition,\npressed us down. I was looking back over my life, and thinking how the cold weight of an unliving spirit was slowly crushing all\nwarmth and vitality out of everything. Even Carlotta herself had gone numb again, cold and resistant even to me. The thing seemed\nto happen wholesale in her.\n\n\"One has to choose to live,\" I said, dancing on.\n\nBut I was powerless. With a woman, when her spirit goes inert in opposition, a man can do nothing. I felt my life-flow sinking in\nmy body.\n\n\"This house is awfully depressing,\" I said to her, as we mechanically danced. \"Why don't you do something? Why don't you get out\nof this tangle? Why don't you break it?\"\n\n\"How?\" she said.\n\nI looked down at her, wondering why she was suddenly hostile.\n\n\"You needn't fight,\" I said. \"You needn't fight it. Don't get tangled up in it. Just side-step, on to another ground.\"\n\nShe made a pause of impatience before she replied:\n\n\"I don't see where I am to side-step to, precisely.\"\n\n\"You do,\" said I. \"A little while ago, you were warm and unfolded and good. Now you are shut up and prickly, in the cold. You\nneedn't be. Why not stay warm?\"\n\n\"It's nothing I do,\" she said coldly.\n\n\"It is. Stay warm to me. I am here. Why clutch in a tug-of-war with Lady Lathkill?\"\n\n\"Do I clutch in a tug-of-war with my mother-in-law?\"\n\n\"You know you do.\"\n\nShe looked up at me, with a faint little shadow of guilt and beseeching, but with a moue of cold obstinacy dominant.\n\n\"Let's have done,\" said I.\n\nAnd in cold silence we sat side by side on the lounge.\n\nThe other two danced on. They at any rate were in unison. One could see from the swing of their limbs. Mrs. Hale's yellow-brown\neyes looked at me every time she came round.\n\n\"Why does she look at me?\" I said.\n\n\"I can't imagine,\" said Carlotta, with a cold grimace.\n\n\"I'd better go upstairs and see what's happening,\" she said, suddenly rising and disappearing in a breath.\n\nWhy should she go? Why should she rush off to the battle of wills with her mother-in-law? In such a battle, while one has any life\nto lose, one can only lose it. There is nothing positively to be done, but to withdraw out of the hateful tension.\n\nThe music ran down. Lord Lathkill stopped the Victrola.\n\n\"Carlotta gone?\" he said.\n\n\"Apparently.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you stop her?\"\n\n\"Wild horses wouldn't stop her.\"\n\nHe lifted his hand with a mocking gesture of helplessness.\n\n\"The lady loves her will,\" he said. \"Would you like to dance?\"\n\nI looked at Mrs. Hale.\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"I won't butt in. I'll play the pianola. The Victrola's a brute.\"\n\nI hardly noticed the passage of time. Whether the others danced or not, I played, and was unconscious of almost everything. In the\nmidst of one rattling piece. Lord Lathkill touched my arm.\n\n\"Listen to Carlotta. She says closing time,\" he said, in his old musical voice, but with the sardonic ring of war in it now.\n\nCarlotta stood with her arms dangling, looking like a penitent schoolgirl.\n\n\"The Colonel has gone to bed. He hasn't been able to manage a reconciliation with Lucy,\" she said. \"My mother-in-law thinks we\nought to let him try to sleep.\"\n\nCarlotta's slow eyes rested on mine, questioning, penitent—or so I imagined—and somewhat sphinx-like.\n\n\"Why, of course,\" said Lord Lathkill. \"I wish him all the sleep in the world.\"\n\nMrs. Hale said never a word.\n\n\"Is Mother retiring too?\" asked Luke.\n\n\"I think so.\"\n\n\"Ah! then supposing we go up and look at the supper-tray.\"\n\nWe found Lady Lathkill mixing herself some night-cap brew over a spirit-lamp: something milky and excessively harmless. She stood\nat the sideboard stirring her potations, and hardly noticed us. When she had finished she sat down with her steaming cup.\n\n\"Colonel Hale all right, Mother?\" said Luke, looking across at her.\n\nThe dowager, under her uplift of white hair, stared back at her son. There was an eye-battle for some moments, during which he\nmaintained his arch, debonair ease, just a bit crazy.\n\n\"No,\" said Lady Lathkill, \"he is in great trouble.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" replied her son. \"Awful pity we can't do anything for him. But if flesh and blood can't help him, I'm afraid I'm a dud.\nSuppose he didn't mind our dancing? Frightfully good for us! We've been forgetting that we're flesh and blood. Mother.\"\n\nHe took another whisky and soda, and gave me one. And in a paralysing silence Lady Lathkill sipped her hot brew, Luke and I sipped\nour whiskies, the young woman ate a little sandwich. We all preserved an extraordinary aplomb, and an obstinate silence.\n\nIt was Lady Lathkill who broke it. She seemed to be sinking downwards, crouching into herself like a skulking animal.\n\n\"I suppose,\" she said, \"we shall all go to bed?\"\n\n\"You go, Mother. We'll come along in a moment.\"\n\nShe went, and for some time we four sat silent. The room seemed to become pleasanter, the air was more grateful.\n\n\"Look here,\" said Lord Lathkill at last. \"What do you think of this ghost business?\"\n\n\"I?\" said I. \"I don't like the atmosphere it produces. There may be ghosts, and spirits, and all that. The dead must be somewhere;\nthere's no such place as nowhere. But they don't affect me particularly. Do they you?\"\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"no, not directly. Indirectly I suppose it does.\"\n\n\"I think it makes a horribly depressing atmosphere, spiritualism,\" said I. \"I want to kick.\"\n\n\"Exactly! And ought one?\" he asked in his terribly sane-seeming way.\n\nThis made me laugh. I knew what he was up to.\n\n\"I don't know what you mean by ought,\" said I. \"If I really want to kick, if I know I can't stand a thing, I kick. Who's going to\nauthorise me, if my own genuine feeling doesn't?\"\n\n\"Quite,\" he said, staring at me like an owl, with a fixed, meditative stare.\n\n\"Do you know,\" he said, \"I suddenly thought at dinner-time, what corpses we all were, sitting eating our dinners. I thought it\nwhen I saw you look at those little Jerusalem artichoke things in a white sauce. Suddenly it struck me, you were alive and\ntwinkling, and we were all bodily dead. Bodily dead, if you understand. Quite alive in other directions, but bodily dead. And\nwhether we ate vegetarian or meat made no difference. We were bodily dead.\"\n\n\"Ah, with a slap in the face,\" said I, \"we come to life! You or I or anybody.\"\n\n\"I do understand poor Lucy,\" said Luke. \"Don't you? She forgot to be flesh and blood while she was alive, and now she can't\nforgive herself, nor the Colonel. That must be pretty rough, you know, not to realise it till you're dead, and you haven't, so to\nspeak, anything left to go on. I mean it's awfully important to be flesh and blood.\"\n\nHe looked so solemnly at us, we three broke simultaneously into an uneasy laugh.\n\n\"Oh, but I do mean it,\" he said. \"I've only realised how very extraordinary it is to be a man of flesh and blood, alive. It seems\nso ordinary, in comparison, to be dead, and merely spirit. That seems so commonplace. But fancy having a living face, and arms,\nand thighs. Oh, my God, I'm glad I've realised in time!\"\n\nHe caught Mrs. Hale's hand, and pressed her dusky arm against his body.\n\n\"Oh, but if one had died without realising it!\" he cried. \"Think how ghastly for Jesus, when he was risen and wasn't touchable!\nHow very awful, to have to say Noli me tangere! Ah, touch me, touch me alive!\"\n\nHe pressed Mrs. Hale's hand convulsively against his breast. The tears had already slowly gathered in Carlotta's eyes and were\ndropping on to her hands in her lap.\n\n\"Don't cry, Carlotta,\" he said. \"Really, don't. We haven't killed one another. We're too decent, after all. We've almost become\ntwo spirits side by side. We've almost become two ghosts to one another, wrestling. Oh, but I want you to get back your body, even\nif I can't give it you. I want my flesh and blood, Carlotta, and I want you to have yours. We've suffered so much the other way.\nAnd the children, it is as well they are dead. They were born of our will and our disembodiment. Oh, I feel like the Bible. Clothe\nme with flesh again, and wrap my bones with sinew, and let the fountain of blood cover me. My spirit is like a naked nerve on the\nair.\"\n\nCarlotta has ceased to weep. She sat with her head dropped, as if asleep. The rise and fall of her small, slack breasts was still\nheavy, but they were lifting on a heaving sea of rest. It was as if a slow, restful dawn were rising in her body, while she slept.\nSo slack, so broken she sat, it occurred to me that in this crucifixion business the crucified does not put himself alone on the\ncross. The woman is nailed even more inexorably up, and crucified in the body even more cruelly.\n\nIt is a monstrous thought. But the deed is even more monstrous. Oh, Jesus, didn't you know that you couldn't be crucified\nalone!—that the two thieves crucified along with you were the two women, your wife and your mother! You called them two thieves.\nBut what would they call you, who had their women's bodies on the cross? The abominable trinity on Calvary!\n\nI felt an infinite tenderness for my dear Carlotta. She could not yet be touched. But my soul streamed to her like warm blood. So\nshe sat slack and drooped, as if broken. But she was not broken. It was only the great release.\n\nLuke sat with the hand of the dark young woman pressed against his breast. His face was warm and fresh, but he too breathed\nheavily, and stared unseeing. Mrs. Hale sat at his side erect and mute. But she loved him, with erect, black-faced, remote power.\n\n\"Morier!\" said Luke to me. \"If you can help Carlotta, you will, won't you? I can't do any more for her now. We are in mortal fear\nof each other.\"\n\n\"As much as she'll let me,\" said I, looking at her drooping figure, that was built on such a strong frame.\n\nThe fire rustled on the hearth as we sat in complete silence. How long it lasted I cannot say. Yet we were none of us startled\nwhen the door opened.\n\nIt was the Colonel, in a handsome brocade dressing-gown, looking worried.\n\nLuke still held the dark young woman's hand clasped against his thigh. Mrs. Hale did not move.\n\n\"I thought you fellows might help me,\" said the Colonel, in a worried voice, as he closed the door.\n\n\"What is wrong, Colonel?\" said Luke.\n\nThe Colonel looked at him, looked at the clasped hands of Luke and the dark young woman, looked at me, looked at Carlotta, without\nchanging his expression of anxiety, fear, and misery. He didn't care about us.\n\n\"I can't sleep,\" he said. \"It's gone wrong again. My head feels as if there was a cold vacuum in it, and my heart beats, and\nsomething screws up inside me. I know it's Lucy. She hates me again. I can't stand it.\"\n\nHe looked at us with eyes half glazed, obsessed. His face seemed as if the flesh were breaking under the skin, decomposing.\n\n\"Perhaps, poor thing,\" said Luke, whose madness seemed really sane this night, \"perhaps you hate her.\"\n\nLuke's strange concentration instantly made us feel a tension, as of hate, in the Colonel's body.\n\n\"I?\" The Colonel looked up sharply, like a culprit. \"I! I wouldn't say that, if I were you.\"\n\n\"Perhaps that's what's the matter,\" said Luke, with mad, beautiful calm. \"Why can't you feel kindly towards her, poor thing! She\nmust have been done out of a lot while she lived.\"\n\nIt was as if he had one foot in life and one in death, and knew both sides. To us it was like madness.\n\n\"I—I!\" stammered the Colonel; and his face was a study. Expression after expression moved across it: of fear, repudiation, dismay,\nanger, repulsion, bewilderment, guilt. \"I was good to her.\"\n\n\"Ah yes,\" said Luke. \"Perhaps you were good to her. But was your body good to poor Lucy's body, poor dead thing!\"\n\nHe seemed to be better acquainted with the ghost than with us.\n\nThe Colonel gazed blankly at Luke, and his eyes went up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down.\n\n\"My body!\" he said blankly.\n\nAnd he looked down amazedly at his little round stomach, under the silk gown, and his stout knee, in its blue-and-white pyjama.\n\n\"My body!\" he repeated blankly.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Luke. \"Don't you see, you may have been awfully good to her. But her poor woman's body, were you ever good to that?\"\n\n\"She had everything she wanted. She had three of my children,\" said the Colonel dazedly.\n\n\"Ah yes, that may easily be. But your body of a man, was it ever good to her body of a woman? That's the point. If you understand\nthe marriage service: with my body I thee worship. That's the point. No getting away from it.\"\n\nThe queerest of all accusing angels did Lord Lathkill make, as he sat there with the hand of the other man's wife clasped against\nhis thigh. His face was fresh and naïve, and the dark eyes were bright with a clairvoyant candour, that was like madness, and\nperhaps was supreme sanity.\n\nThe Colonel was thinking back, and over his face a slow understanding was coming.\n\n\"It may be,\" he said. \"It may be. Perhaps, that way, I despised her. It may be, it may be.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Luke. \"As if she weren't worth noticing, what you did to her. Haven't I done it myself? And don't I know now, it's\na horrible thing to do, to oneself as much as to her? Her poor ghost, that ached, and never had a real body! It's not so easy to\nworship with the body. Ah, if the Church taught us that sacrament: with my body I thee worship! that would easily make up for any\nhonouring and obeying the woman might do. But that's why she haunts you. You ignored and disliked her body, and she was only a\nliving ghost. Now she wails in the afterworld, like a still-wincing nerve.\"\n\nThe Colonel hung his head, slowly pondering. Pondering with all his body. His young wife watched the sunken, bald head in a kind\nof stupor. His day seemed so far from her day. Carlotta had lifted her face; she was beautiful again, with the tender before-dawn\nfreshness of a new understanding.\n\nShe was watching Luke, and it was obvious, he was another man to her. The man she knew, the Luke who was her husband, was gone,\nand this other strange, uncanny creature had taken his place. She was filled with wonder. Could one so change, as to become\nanother creature entirely? Ah, if it were so! If she herself, as she knew herself, could cease to be! If that woman who was\nmarried to Luke, married to him in an intimacy of misfortune that was like a horror, could only cease to be, and let a new,\ndelicately-wild Carlotta take her place!\n\n\"It may be,\" said the Colonel, lifting his head. \"It may be.\" There seemed to come a relief over his soul, as he realised. \"I\ndidn't worship her with my body. I think maybe I worshipped other women that way; but maybe I never did. But I thought I was good\nto her. And I thought she didn't want it.\"\n\n\"It's no good thinking. We all want it,\" asserted Luke. \"And before we die, we know it. I say, before we die. It may be after. But\neverybody wants it, let them say and do what they will. Don't you agree, Morier?\"\n\nI was startled when he spoke to me. I had been thinking of Carlotta: how she was looking like a girl again, as she used to look at\nthe Thwaite, when she painted cactuses-in-a-pot. Only now, a certain rigidity of the will had left her, so that she looked even\nyounger than when I first knew her, having now a virginal, flower-like stillness which she had not had then. I had always believed\nthat people could be born again: if they would only let themselves.\n\n\"I'm sure they do,\" I said to Luke.\n\nBut I was thinking, if people were born again, the old circumstances would not fit the new body.\n\n\"What about yourself, Luke?\" said Carlotta abruptly.\n\n\"I!\" he exclaimed, and the scarlet showed in his cheek. \"I! I'm not fit to be spoken about. I've been moaning like the ghost of\ndisembodiment myself, ever since I became a man.\"\n\nThe Colonel said never a word. He hardly listened. He was pondering, pondering. In his way, he too was a brave man.\n\n\"I have an idea what you mean,\" he said. \"There's no denying it, I didn't like her body. And now, I suppose, it's too late.\"\n\nHe looked up bleakly: in a way, willing to be condemned, since he knew vaguely that something was wrong. Anything better than the\nblind torture.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" said Luke. \"Why don't you, even now, love her a little with your real heart? Poor disembodied thing! Why don't\nyou take her to your warm heart, even now, and comfort her inside there. Why don't you be kind to her poor ghost, bodily?\"\n\nThe Colonel did not answer. He was gazing fixedly at Luke. Then he turned, and dropped his head, alone in a deep silence. Then,\ndeliberately, but not lifting his head, he pulled open his dressing-gown at the breast, unbuttoned the top of his pyjama jacket,\nand sat perfectly still, his breast showing white and very pure, so much younger and purer than his averted face. He breathed with\ndifficulty, his white breast rising irregularly. But in the deep isolation where he was, slowly a gentleness of compassion came\nover him, moulding his elderly features with strange freshness, and softening his blue eye with a look it had never had before.\nSomething of the tremulous gentleness of a young bridegroom had come upon him, in spite of his baldness, his silvery little\nmoustache, the weary marks of his face.\n\nThe passionate, compassionate soul stirred in him and was pure, his youth flowered over his face and eyes.\n\nWe sat very still, moved also in the spirit of compassion. There seemed a presence in the air, almost a smell of blossom, as if\ntime had opened and gave off the perfume of spring. The Colonel gazed in silence into space, his smooth white chest, with the few\ndark hairs, open and rising and sinking with life.\n\nMeanwhile his dark-faced young wife watched as if from afar. The youngness that was on him was not for her.\n\nI knew that Lady Lathkill would come. I could feel her far off in her room, stirring and sending forth her rays. Swiftly I steeled\nmyself to be in readiness. When the door opened, I rose and walked across the room.\n\nShe entered with characteristic noiselessness, peering in round the door, with her crest of white hair, before she ventured bodily\nin. The Colonel looked at her swiftly, and swiftly covered his breast, holding his hand at his bosom, clutching the silk of his\nrobe.\n\n\"I was afraid,\" she murmured, \"that Colonel Hale might be in trouble.\"\n\n\"No,\" said I. \"We are all sitting very peacefully. There is no trouble.\"\n\nLord Lathkill also rose.\n\n\"No trouble at all, I assure you. Mother!\" he said.\n\nLady Lathkill glanced at us both, then turned heavily to the Colonel.\n\n\"She is unhappy to-night?\" she asked.\n\nThe Colonel winced.\n\n\"No,\" he said hurriedly. \"No, I don't think so.\" He looked up at her with shy, wincing eyes.\n\n\"Tell me what I can do,\" she said in a very low tone, bending towards him.\n\n\"Our ghost is walking to-night. Mother,\" said Lord Lathkill. \"Haven't you felt the air of spring, and smelt the plum-blossom?\nDon't you feel us all young? Our ghost is walking, to bring Lucy home. The Colonel's breast is quite extraordinary, white as\nplum-blossom. Mother, younger-looking than mine, and he's already taken Lucy into his bosom, in his breast, where he breathes like\nthe wind among trees. The Colonel's breast is white and extraordinarily beautiful. Mother, I don't wonder poor Lucy yearned for\nit, to go home into it at last. It's like going into an orchard of plum-blossom, for a ghost.\"\n\nHis mother looked round at him, then back at the Colonel, who was still clutching his hand over his chest, as if protecting\nsomething.\n\n\"You see, I didn't understand where I'd been wrong,\" he said, looking up at her imploringly. \"I never realised that it was my body\nwhich had not been good to her.\"\n\nLady Lathkill curved sideways to watch him. But her power was gone. His face had come smooth with the tender glow of compassionate\nlife, that flowers again. She could not get at him.\n\n\"It's no good, Mother. You know our ghost is walking. She's supposed to be absolutely like a crocus, if you know what I mean:\nharbinger of spring in the earth. So it says in my great-grandfather's diary: for she rises with silence like a crocus at the\nfeet, and violets in the hollows of the heart come out. For she is of the feet and the hands, the thighs and breast, the face and\nthe all-concealing belly, and her name is silent, but her odour is of spring, and her contact is the all-in-all.\" He was quoting\nfrom his great-grandfather's diary, which only the sons of the family read. And as he quoted he rose curiously on his toes, and\nspread his fingers, bringing his hands together till the finger-tips touched. His father had done that before him, when he was\ndeeply moved.\n\nLady Lathkill sat down heavily in the chair next the Colonel.\n\n\"How do you feel?\" she asked him, in a secretive mutter.\n\nHe looked round at her, with the large blue eyes of candour.\n\n\"I never knew what was wrong,\" he said, a little nervously. \"She only wanted to be looked after a bit, not to be a homeless,\nhouseless ghost. It's all right! She's all right here.\" He pressed his clutched hand on his breast. \"It's all right; it's all\nright. She'll be all right now.\"\n\nHe rose, a little fantastic in his brocade gown, but once more manly, candid and sober.\n\n\"With your permission,\" he said, \"I will retire.\"—He made a little bow.—\"I am glad you helped me. I didn't know—didn't know.\"\n\nBut the change in him, and his secret wondering were so strong on him, he went out of the room scarcely being aware of us.\n\nLord Lathkill threw up his arms, and stretched, quivering.\n\n\"Oh, pardon, pardon,\" he said, seeming, as he stretched, quivering, to grow bigger and almost splendid, sending out rays of fire\nto the dark young woman. \"Oh, Mother, thank you for my limbs, and my body! Oh, Mother, thank you for my knees and my shoulders at\nthis moment! Oh, Mother, thank you that my body is straight and alive! Oh, Mother, torrents of spring, torrents of spring, whoever\nsaid that?\"\n\n\"Don't you forget yourself, my boy?\" said his mother.\n\n\"Oh no, dear, no! Oh, Mother dear, a man has to be in love in his thighs, the way you ride a horse. Why don't we stay in love that\nway all our lives? Why do we turn into corpses with consciousness? Oh, Mother of my body, thank you for my body, you strange woman\nwith white hair! I don't know much about you, but my body came from you, so thank you, my dear. I shall think of you to-night!\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better go?\" she said, beginning to tremble.\n\n\"Why, yes,\" he said, turning and looking strangely at the dark young woman. \"Yes, let us go; let us go!\"\n\nCarlotta gazed at him, then, with strange, heavy, searching look, at me. I smiled to her, and she looked away. The dark young\nwoman looked over her shoulder as she went out. Lady Lathkill hurried past her son, with head ducked. But still he laid his hand\non her shoulder, and she stopped dead.\n\n\"Good-night, Mother, Mother of my face and my thighs. Thank you for the night to come, dear. Mother of my body.\"\n\nShe glanced up at him rapidly, nervously, then hurried away. He stared after her, then switched off the light.\n\n\"Funny old Mother!\" he said. \"I never realised before that she was the mother of my shoulders and my hips, as well as my brain.\nMother of my thighs!\"\n\nHe switched off some of the lights as we went, accompanying me to my room.\n\n\"You know,\" he said, \"I can understand that the Colonel is happy, now the forlorn ghost of Lucy is comforted in his heart. After\nall, he married her! And she must be content at last: he has a beautiful chest, don't you think? Together they will sleep well.\nAnd then he will begin to live the life of the living again. How friendly the house feels to-night! But, after all, it is my old\nhome. And the smell of plum-blossom—don't you notice it? It is our ghost, in silence like a crocus. There, your fire has died\ndown! But it's a nice room! I hope our ghost will come to you. I think she will. Don't speak to her. It makes her go away. She,\ntoo, is a ghost of silence. We talk far too much. But now I am going to be silent too, and a ghost of silence. Good-night!\"\n\nHe closed the door softly and was gone. And softly, in silence, I took off my things. I was thinking of Carlotta, and a little\nsadly, perhaps, because of the power of circumstance over us. This night I could have worshipped her with my body, and she,\nperhaps, was stripped in the body to be worshipped. But it was not for me, at this hour, to fight against circumstances.\n\nI had fought too much, even against the most imposing circumstances, to use any more violence for love. Desire is a sacred thing,\nand should not be violated.\n\n\"Hush!\" I said to myself. \"I will sleep, and the ghost of my silence can go forth, in the subtle body of desire, to meet that\nwhich is coming to meet it. Let my ghost go forth, and let me not interfere. There are many intangible meetings, and unknown\nfulfilments of desire.\"\n\nSo I went softly to sleep, as I wished to, without interfering with the warm, crocus-like ghost of my body.\n\nAnd I must have gone far, far down the intricate galleries of sleep, to the very heart of the world. For I know I passed on beyond\nthe strata of images and words, beyond the iron veins of memory, and even the jewels of rest, to sink in the final dark like a\nfish, dumb, soundless, and imageless, yet alive and swimming.\n\nAnd at the very core of the deep night the ghost came to me, at the heart of the ocean of oblivion, which is also the heart of\nlife. Beyond hearing, or even knowledge of contact, I met her and knew her. How I know it I don't know. Yet I know it with\neyeless, wingless knowledge.\n\nFor man in the body is formed through countless ages, and at the centre is the speck, or spark, upon which all his formation has\ntaken place. It is even not himself, deep beyond his many depths. Deep from him calls to deep. And according as deep answers deep,\nman glistens and surpasses himself.\n\nBeyond all the pearly mufflings of consciousness, of age upon age of consciousness, deep calls yet to deep, and sometimes is\nanswered. It is calling and answering, new-wakened God calling within the deep of a man, and new God calling answer from the other\ndeep. And sometimes the other deep is a woman, as it was with me, when my ghost came.\n\nWomen were not unknown to me. But never before had woman come, in the depths of night, to answer my deep with her deep. As the\nghost came, came as a ghost of silence, still in the depth of sleep.\n\nI know she came. I know she came even as a woman, to my man. But the knowledge is darkly naked as the event. I only know, it was\nso. In the deep of sleep a call was called from the deeps of me, and answered in the deeps, by a woman among women. Breasts or\nthighs or face, I remember not a touch, no, nor a movement of my own. It is all complete in the profundity of darkness. Yet I know\nit was so.\n\nI awoke towards dawn, from far, far away. I was vaguely conscious of drawing nearer and nearer, as the sun must have been drawing\ntowards the horizon, from the complete beyond. Till at last the faint pallor of mental consciousness coloured my waking.\n\nAnd then I was aware of a pervading scent, as of plum-blossom, and a sense of extraordinary silkiness—though where, and in what\ncontact, I could not say. It was as the first blemish of dawn.\n\nAnd even with so slight a conscious registering, it seemed to disappear. Like a whale that has sounded to the bottomless seas.\nThat knowledge of it, which was the marriage of the ghost and me, disappeared from me, in its rich weight of certainty, as the\nscent of the plum-blossom moved down the lanes of my consciousness, and my limbs stirred in a silkiness for which I have no\ncomparison.\n\nAs I became aware, I also became uncertain. I wanted to be certain of it, to have definite evidence. And as I sought for\nevidence, it disappeared, my perfect knowledge was gone. I no longer knew in full.\n\nNow as the daylight slowly amassed, in the windows from which I had put back the shutters, I sought in myself for evidence, and in\nthe room.\n\nBut I shall never know. I shall never know if it was a ghost, some sweet spirit from the innermost of the ever-deepening cosmos;\nor a woman, a very woman, as the silkiness of my limbs seems to attest; or a dream, a hallucination! I shall never know. Because I\nwent away from Riddings in the morning, on account of the sudden illness of Lady Lathkill.\n\n\"You will come again,\" Luke said to me. \"And in any case, you will never really go away from us.\"\n\n\"Good-bye,\" she said to me. \"At last it was perfect!\"\n\nShe seemed so beautiful, when I left her, as if it were the ghost again, and I was far down the deeps of consciousness.\n\nThe following autumn, when I was overseas once more, I had a letter from Lord Lathkill. He wrote very rarely.\n\n\"Carlotta has a son,\" he said, \"and I an heir. He has yellow hair, like a little crocus, and one of the young plum-trees in the\norchard has come out of all season into blossom. To me he is flesh and blood of our ghost itself. Even mother doesn't look over\nthe wall, to the other side, any more. It's all this side for her now.\n\n\"So our family refuses to die out, by the grace of our ghost. We are calling him Gabriel.\n\n\"Dorothy Hale also is a mother, three days before Carlotta. She has a black lamb of a daughter, called Gabrielle. By the bleat of\nthe little thing, I know its father. Our own is a blue-eyed one, with the dangerous repose of a pugilist. I have no fears of our\nfamily misfortune for him, ghost-begotten and ready-fisted.\n\n\"The Colonel is very well, quiet and self-possessed. He is farming in Wiltshire, raising pigs. It is a passion with him, the crême\nde la crême of swine. I admit, he has golden sows as elegant as a young Diane de Poitiers, and young hogs like Perseus in the\nfirst red-gold flush of youth. He looks me in the eye, and I look him back, and we understand. He is quiet, and proud now, and\nvery hale and hearty, raising swine ad maiorem gloriam Dei. A good sport!\n\n\"I am in love with this house and its inmates, including the plum-blossom-scented one, she who visited you, in all the peace. I\ncannot understand why you wander in uneasy and distant parts of the earth. For me, when I am at home, I am there. I have peace\nupon my bones, and if the world is going to come to a violent and untimely end, as prophets aver, I feel the house of Lathkill\nwill survive, built upon our ghost. So come back, and you'll find we shall not have gone away....\"",
  "contentHtml": "<h4>GLAD GHOSTS</h4>\r\n<p>I knew Carlotta Fell in the early days before the war. Then she was escaping into art, and was just \"Fell.\" That was at our famous but uninspired school of art, the Thwaite, where I myself was diligently murdering my talent. At the Thwaite they always gave Carlotta the Still-life prizes. She accepted them calmly, as one of our conquerors, but the rest of the students felt vicious about it. They called it buttering the laurels, because Carlotta was Hon., and her father a well-known peer.</p>\r\n<p>She was by way of being a beauty, too. Her family was not rich, yet she had come into five hundred a year of her own, when she was eighteen; and that, to us, was an enormity. Then she appeared in the fashionable papers, affecting to be wistful, with pearls, slanting her eyes. Then she went and did another of her beastly still-lives, a cactus-in-a-pot.</p>\r\n<p>At the Thwaite, being snobs, we were proud of her too. She showed off a bit, it is true, playing bird of paradise among the pigeons. At the same time, she was thrilled to be with us, and out of her own set. Her wistfulness and yearning \"for something else\" was absolutely genuine. Yet she was not going to hobnob with us either, at least not indiscriminately.</p>\r\n<p>She was ambitious, in a vague way. She wanted to coruscate, somehow or other. She had a family of clever and \"distinguished\" uncles, who had flattered her. What then?</p>\r\n<p>Her cactuses-in-a-pot were admirable. But even she didn't expect them to start a revolution. Perhaps she would rather glow in the wide if dirty skies of life, than in the somewhat remote and unsatisfactory ether of Art.</p>\r\n<p>She and I were \"friends\" in a bare, stark, but real sense. I was poor, but I didn't really care. She didn't really care either. Whereas I did care about some passionate vision which, I could feel, lay embedded in the half-dead body of this life. The quick body within the dead. I could&nbsp;<em>feel</em>&nbsp;it. And I wanted to get at it, if only for myself.</p>\r\n<p>She didn't know what I was after. Yet she could feel that I was It, and being an aristocrat of the Kingdom of It, as well as the realm of Great Britain, she was loyal&mdash;loyal to me because of It, the quick body which I imagined within the dead.</p>\r\n<p>Still, we never had much to do with one another. I had no money. She never wanted to introduce me to her own people. I didn't want it either. Sometimes we had lunch together, sometimes we went to a theatre, or we drove in the country, in some car that belonged to neither of us. We never flirted or talked love. I don't think she wanted it, any more than I did. She wanted to marry into her own surroundings, and I knew she was of too frail a paste to face my future.</p>\r\n<p>Now I come to think of it, she was always a bit sad when we were together. Perhaps she looked over seas she would never cross. She belonged finally, fatally, to her own class. Yet I think she hated them. When she was in a group of people who talked \"smart,\" titles and&nbsp;<em>beau monde</em>&nbsp;and all that, her rather short nose would turn up, her wide mouth press into discontent, and a languor of bored irritation come even over her broad shoulders. Bored irritation, and a loathing of climbers, a loathing of the ladder altogether. She hated her own class: yet it was also sacrosanct to her. She disliked, even to me, mentioning the title of her friends. Yet the very hurried resentment with which she said, when I asked her. Who is it?&mdash;</p>\r\n<p>\"Lady Nithsdale, Lord Staines&mdash;old friends of my mother,\" proved that the coronet was wedged into her brow, like a ring of iron grown into a tree.</p>\r\n<p>She had another kind of reverence for a true artist: perhaps more genuine, perhaps not; anyhow, more free and easy.</p>\r\n<p>She and I had a curious understanding in common: an inkling, perhaps, of the unborn body of life hidden within the body of this half-death which we call life; and hence a tacit hostility to the commonplace world, its inert laws. We were rather like two soldiers on a secret mission in an enemy country. Life, and people, was an enemy country to us both. But she would never declare herself.</p>\r\n<p>She always came to me to find out what I thought, particularly in a moral issue. Profoundly, fretfully discontented with the conventional moral standards, she didn't know how to take a stand of her own. So she came to me. She had to try to get her own feelings straightened out. In that she showed her old British fibre. I told her what, as a young man, I thought: and usually she was resentful. She did so want to be conventional. She would even act quite perversely, in her determination to be conventional. But she always had to come back to me, to ask me again. She depended on me morally. Even when she disagreed with me, it soothed her, and restored her to know my point of view. Yet she disagreed with me.</p>\r\n<p>We had then a curious abstract intimacy, that went very deep, yet showed no obvious contact. Perhaps I was the only person in the world with whom she felt, in her uneasy self, at home, at peace. And to me, she was always of my own&nbsp;<em>intrinsic</em>&nbsp;sort, of my own species. Most people are just another species to me. They might as well be turkeys.</p>\r\n<p>But she would always&nbsp;<em>act</em>&nbsp;according to the conventions of her class, even perversely. And I knew it.</p>\r\n<p>So, just before the war she married Lord Lathkill. She was twenty-one. I did not see her till war was declared; then she asked me to lunch with her and her husband, in town. He was an officer in a Guards regiment, and happened to be in uniform, looking very handsome and well-set-up, as if he expected to find the best of life served up to him for ever. He was very dark, with dark eyes and fine black hair, and a very beautiful, diffident voice, almost womanish in its slow, delicate inflections. He seemed pleased and flattered at having Carlotta for a wife.</p>\r\n<p>To me he was beautifully attentive, almost deferential, because I was poor, and of the other world, those poor devils of outsiders. I laughed at him a little, and laughed at Carlotta, who was a bit irritated by the gentle delicacy with which he treated me.</p>\r\n<p>She was elated too. I remember her saying, \"We need war, don't you think? Don't you think men need the fight, to keep life chivalrous and put martial glamour into it?\"</p>\r\n<p>And I remember saying, \"I think we need some sort of fight; but my sort isn't the war sort.\" It was August, we could take it lightly.</p>\r\n<p>\"What's your sort?\" she asked quickly.</p>\r\n<p>\"I don't know: single-handed, anyhow,\" I said, with a grin. Lord Lathkill made me feel like a lonely sansculotte; he was so completely unostentatious, so very willing to pay all the attention to me, and yet so subtly complacent, so unquestioningly sure of his position. Whereas I was not a very sound earthenware pitcher which had already gone many times to the well.</p>\r\n<p>He was not conceited, not half as&nbsp;<em>conceited</em>&nbsp;as I was. He was willing to leave me all the front of the stage, even with Carlotta. He felt so sure of some things, like a tortoise in a glittering, polished tortoiseshell that mirrors eternity. Yet he was not quite easy with me.</p>\r\n<p>\"You are Derbyshire?\" I said to him, looking into his face. \"So am I! I was born in Derbyshire.\"</p>\r\n<p>He asked me with a gentle, uneasy sort of politeness, where? But he was a bit taken aback. And his dark eyes, brooding over me, had a sort of fear in them. At the centre they were hollow with a certain misgiving. He was so sure of&nbsp;<em>circumstances</em>, and not by any means sure of the man in the middle of the circumstances. Himself! Himself! That was already a ghost.</p>\r\n<p>I felt that he saw in me something crude but real, and saw himself as something in its own way perfect, but quite unreal. Even his love for Carlotta, and his marriage, was a circumstance that was inwardly unreal to him. One could tell by the curious way in which he waited, before he spoke. And by the hollow look, almost a touch of madness, in his dark eyes, and in his soft, melancholy voice.</p>\r\n<p>I could understand that she was fascinated by him. But God help him if ever circumstances went against him!</p>\r\n<p>She had to see me again, a week later, to talk about him. So she asked me to the opera. She had a box, and we were alone, and the notorious Lady Perth was two boxes away. But this was one of Carlotta's conventional perverse little acts, with her husband in France. She only wanted to talk to me about him.</p>\r\n<p>So she sat in the front of her box, leaning a little to the audience and talking sideways to me. Anyone would have known at once there was a&nbsp;<em>liaison</em>&nbsp;between us, how&nbsp;<em>dangereuse</em>&nbsp;they would never have guessed. For there, in the full view of the world&mdash;her world at least, not mine&mdash;she was talking sideways to me, saying in a hurried, yet stony voice:</p>\r\n<p>\"What do you think of Luke?\"</p>\r\n<p>She looked up at me heavily, with her sea-coloured eyes, waiting for my answer.</p>\r\n<p>\"He's tremendously charming,\" I said, above the theatreful of faces.</p>\r\n<p>\"Yes, he's that!\" she replied, in the flat, plangent voice she had when she was serious, like metal ringing flat, with a strange far-reaching vibration. \"Do you think he'll be happy?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"<em>Be</em>&nbsp;happy!\" I ejaculated. \"When,&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;happy?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"With me,\" she said, giving a sudden little snirt of laughter, like a schoolgirl, and looking up at me shyly, mischievously, anxiously.</p>\r\n<p>\"If you make him,\" I said, still casual.</p>\r\n<p>\"How can I make him?\"</p>\r\n<p>She said it with flat, plangent earnestness. She was always like that, pushing me deeper in than I wanted to go.</p>\r\n<p>\"Be happy yourself, I suppose: and quite sure about it. And then&nbsp;<em>tell</em>&nbsp;him you're happy, and tell him he is too, and he'll be it.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Must I do all that?\" she said rapidly. \"Not otherwise?\"</p>\r\n<p>I knew I was frowning at her, and she was watching my frown.</p>\r\n<p>\"Probably not,\" I said roughly. \"He'll never make up his mind about it himself.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"How did you know?\" she asked, as if it had been a mystery.</p>\r\n<p>\"I didn't. It only seems to me like that.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Seems to you like that,\" she re-echoed, in that sad, clean monotone of finality, always like metal. I appreciate it in her, that she does not murmur or whisper. But I wished she left me alone, in that beastly theatre.</p>\r\n<p>She was wearing emeralds, on her snow-white skin, and leaning forward gazing fixedly down into the auditorium, as a crystal-gazer into a crystal. Heaven knows if she saw all those little facets of faces and plastrons. As for me, I knew that, like a sansculotte, I should never be king till breeches were off.</p>\r\n<p>\"I had terrible work to make him marry me,\" she said, in her swift, clear low tones.</p>\r\n<p>\"Why?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"He was frightfully in love with me. He&nbsp;<em>is</em>! But he thinks he's unlucky...\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Unlucky, how? In cards or in love?\" I mocked.</p>\r\n<p>\"In both,\" she said briefly, with sudden cold resentment at my flippancy. There was over her eyes a glaze of fear. \"It's in their family.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"What did you say to him?\" I asked, rather laboured, feeling the dead weight.</p>\r\n<p>\"I promised to have luck for two,\" she said. \"And war was declared a fortnight later.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Ah, well!\" I said. \"That's the world's luck, not yours.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Quite!\" she said.</p>\r\n<p>There was a pause.</p>\r\n<p>\"Is his family supposed to be unlucky?\" I asked.</p>\r\n<p>\"The Worths? Terribly! They really are!\"</p>\r\n<p>It was interval, and the box door had opened. Carlotta always had her eye, a good half of it at least, on the external happenings. She rose, like a reigning beauty&mdash;which she wasn't, and never became&mdash;to speak to Lady Perth, and, out of spite, did not introduce me.</p>\r\n<p>Carlotta and Lord Lathkill came, perhaps a year later, to visit us when we were in a cottage in Derbyshire, and he was home on leave. She was going to have a child, and was slow, and seemed depressed. He was vague, charming, talking about the country and the history of the lead mines. But the two of them seemed vague, as if they never got anywhere.</p>\r\n<p>The last time I saw them was when the war was over, and I was leaving England. They were alone at dinner, save for me. He was still haggard, with a wound in the throat. But he said he would soon be well. His slow, beautiful voice was a bit husky now. And his velvety eyes were hardened, haggard, but there was weariness, emptiness in the hardness.</p>\r\n<p>I was poorer than ever, and felt a little weary myself. Carlotta was struggling with his silent emptiness. Since the war, the melancholy fixity of his eyes was more noticeable, the fear at the centre was almost monomania. She was wilting and losing her beauty.</p>\r\n<p>There were twins in the house. After dinner, we went straight up to look at them, to the night nursery. They were two boys, with their father's fine dark hair, both of them.</p>\r\n<p>He had put out his cigar, and leaned over the cots, gazing in silence. The nurse, dark-faced and faithful, drew back. Carlotta glanced at her children; but more helplessly, she gazed at him.</p>\r\n<p>\"Bonny children! Bonny boys, aren't they, nurse?\" I said softly.</p>\r\n<p>\"Yes, sir!\" she said quickly. \"They are!\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Ever think I'd have twins, roistering twins?\" said Carlotta, looking at me.</p>\r\n<p>\"I never did,\" said I.</p>\r\n<p>\"Ask Luke whether it's bad luck or bad management,\" she said, with that schoolgirl's snirt of laughter, looking up apprehensively at her husband.</p>\r\n<p>\"Oh, I!\" he said, turning suddenly and speaking loud, in his wounded voice. \"I call it amazing good luck, myself! Don't know what other people think about it.\" Yet he had the fine, wincing fear in his body, of an injured dog.</p>\r\n<p>After that, for years I did not see her again. I heard she had a baby girl. Then a catastrophe happened: both the twins were killed in a motor-car accident in America, motoring with their aunt.</p>\r\n<p>I learned the news late, and did not write to Carlotta. What could I say?</p>\r\n<p>A few months later, crowning disaster, the baby girl died of some sudden illness. The Lathkill ill-luck seemed to be working surely.</p>\r\n<p>Poor Carlotta! I had no further news of her, only I heard that she and Lord Lathkill were both living in seclusion, with his mother, at the place in Derbyshire.</p>\r\n<p>When circumstances brought me to England, I debated within myself, whether I should write or not to Carlotta. At last I sent a note to the London address.</p>\r\n<p>I had a reply from the country: \"So glad you are within reach again! When will you come and see us?\"</p>\r\n<p>I was not very keen on going to Riddings. After all, it was Lord Lathkill's place, and Lady Lathkill, his mother, was old and of the old school. And I always something of a sansculotte, who will only be king when breeches are off.</p>\r\n<p>\"Come to town,\" I wrote, \"and let us have lunch together.\"</p>\r\n<p>She came. She looked older, and pain had drawn horizontal lines across her face.</p>\r\n<p>\"You're not a bit different,\" she said to me.</p>\r\n<p>\"And you're only a little bit,\" I said.</p>\r\n<p>\"Am I!\" she replied, in a deadened, melancholic voice. \"Perhaps! I suppose while we live we've got to live. What do you think?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Yes, I think it. To be the living dead, that's awful.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Quite!\" she said, with terrible finality.</p>\r\n<p>\"How is Lord Lathkill?\" I asked.</p>\r\n<p>\"Oh,\" she said. \"It's finished him, as far as living is concerned. But he's very willing for&nbsp;<em>me</em>&nbsp;to live.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"And you, are you willing?\" I said.</p>\r\n<p>She looked up into my eyes, strangely.</p>\r\n<p>\"I'm not sure,\" she said. \"I need help. What do you think about it?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Oh God, live if you can!\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Even take help?\" she said, with her strange involved simplicity.</p>\r\n<p>\"Ah, certainly!\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Would you recommend it?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Why, yes! You are a young thing&mdash;&mdash;\" I began.</p>\r\n<p>\"Won't you come down to Riddings?\" she said quickly.</p>\r\n<p>\"And Lord Lathkill&mdash;and his mother?\" I asked.</p>\r\n<p>\"They want you.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Do you want me to come?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"I want you to, yes! Will you?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Why, yes, if you want me.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"When, then?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"When you wish.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Do you mean it?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Why, of course.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"You're not afraid of the Lathkill ill-luck?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"<em>I</em>!\" I exclaimed in amazement; such amazement, that she gave her schoolgirl snirt of laughter.</p>\r\n<p>\"Very well, then,\" she said. \"Monday? Does that suit you?\"</p>\r\n<p>We made arrangements, and I saw her off at the station.</p>\r\n<p>I knew Riddings, Lord Lathkill's place, from the outside. It was an old Derbyshire stone house, at the end of the village of Middleton: a house with three sharp gables, set back not very far from the high road, but with a gloomy moor for a park behind.</p>\r\n<p>Monday was a dark day over the Derbyshire hills. The green hills were dark, dark green, the stone fences seemed almost black. Even the little railway-station, deep in the green, cleft hollow, was of stone, and dark and cold, and seemed in the underworld.</p>\r\n<p>Lord Lathkill was at the station. He was wearing spectacles, and his brown eyes stared strangely. His black hair fell lank over his forehead.</p>\r\n<p>\"I'm so awfully glad you've come,\" he said. \"It is cheering Carlotta up immensely.\"</p>\r\n<p>Me, as a man myself, he hardly seemed to notice. I was something which had arrived, and was expected. Otherwise he had an odd, unnatural briskness of manner.</p>\r\n<p>\"I hope I shan't disturb your mother. Lady Lathkill,\" I said as he tucked me up in the car.</p>\r\n<p>\"On the contrary,\" he sang, in his slow voice, \"she is looking forward to your coming as much as we both are. Oh, no, don't look on Mother as too old-fashioned, she's not so at all. She's tremendously up-to-date in art and literature and that kind of thing. She has her leaning towards the uncanny&mdash;spiritualism, and that kind of thing&mdash;nowadays, but Carlotta and I think that if it gives her an interest, all well and good.\"</p>\r\n<p>He tucked me up most carefully in the rugs, and the servant put a footwarmer at my feet.</p>\r\n<p>\"Derbyshire, you know, is a cold county,\" continued Lord Lathkill, \"especially among the hills.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"It's a very dark county,\" I said.</p>\r\n<p>\"Yes, I suppose it is, to one coming from the tropics. We, of course, don't notice it; we rather like it.\"</p>\r\n<p>He seemed curiously smaller, shrunken, and his rather long cheeks were sallow. His manner, however, was much more cheerful, almost communicative. But he talked, as it were, to the faceless air, not really to me. I wasn't really there at all. He was talking to himself. And when once he looked at me, his brown eyes had a hollow look, like gaps with nothing in them except a haggard, hollow fear. He was gazing through the windows of nothingness, to see if I were really there.</p>\r\n<p>It was dark when we got to Riddings. The house had no door in the front, and only two windows upstairs were lit. It did not seem very hospitable. We entered at the side, and a very silent manservant took my things.</p>\r\n<p>We went upstairs in silence, in the dead-seeming house. Carlotta had heard us, and was at the top of the stairs. She was already dressed; her long white arms were bare; she had something glittering on a dull green dress.</p>\r\n<p>\"I was so afraid you wouldn't come,\" she said, in a dulled voice, as she gave me her hand. She seemed as if she would begin to cry. But of course she wouldn't. The corridor, dark-panelled and with blue carpet on the floor, receded dimly, with a certain dreary gloom. A servant was diminishing in the distance, with my bags, silently. There was a curious, unpleasant sense of the fixity of the materials of the house, the obscene triumph of dead Matter. Yet the place was warm, central-heated.</p>\r\n<p>Carlotta pulled herself together, and said, dulled:</p>\r\n<p>\"Would you care to speak to my mother-in-law before you go to your room? She would like it.\"</p>\r\n<p>We entered a small drawing-room, abruptly. I saw the water-colours on the walls and a white-haired lady in black bending round to look at the door as she rose, cautiously.</p>\r\n<p>\"This is Mr. Morier, Mother-in-law,\" said Carlotta, in her dull, rather quick way, \"on his way to his room.\"</p>\r\n<p>The dowager Lady Lathkill came a few steps forward, leaning from heavy hips, and gave me her hand. Her crest of hair was snow white, and she had curious blue eyes, fixed, with a tiny dot of a pupil, peering from her pink, soft-skinned face of an old and well-preserved woman. She wore a lace fichu. The upper part of her body was moderately slim, leaning forward slightly from her heavy black-silk hips.</p>\r\n<p>She murmured something to me, staring at me fixedly for a long time, but as a bird does, with shrewd, cold, far-distant sight. As a hawk, perhaps, looks shrewdly far down, in his search. Then, muttering, she presented to me the other two people in the room: a tall, short-faced, swarthy young woman with the hint of a black moustache; and a plump man in a dinner-jacket, rather bald and ruddy, with a little grey moustache, but yellow under the eyes. He was Colonel Hale.</p>\r\n<p>They all seemed awkward, as if I had interrupted them at a s&eacute;ance. I didn't know what to say: they were utter strangers to me.</p>\r\n<p>\"Better come and choose your room, then,\" said Carlotta, and I bowed dumbly, following her out of the room. The old Lady Lathkill still stood planted on her heavy hips, looking half round after us with her ferret's blue eyes. She had hardly any eyebrows, but they were arched high up on her pink, soft forehead, under the crest of icily white hair. She had never emerged for a second from the remote place where she unyieldingly kept herself.</p>\r\n<p>Carlotta, Lord Lathkill and I tramped in silence down the corridor and round a bend. We could none of us get a word out. As he suddenly, rather violently flung open a door at the end of the wing, he said, turning round to me with a resentful, hangdog air:</p>\r\n<p>\"We did you the honour of offering you our ghost room. It doesn't look much, but it's our equivalent for a royal apartment.\"</p>\r\n<p>It was a good-sized room with faded, red-painted panelling showing remains of gilt, and the usual big, old mahogany furniture, and a big pinky-faded carpet with big, whitish, faded roses. A bright fire was burning in the stone fireplace.</p>\r\n<p>\"Why?\" said I, looking at the stretches of the faded, once handsome carpet.</p>\r\n<p>\"Why what?\" said Lord Lathkill. \"Why did we offer you this room?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Yes! No! Why is it your equivalent for a royal apartment?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Oh, because our ghost is as rare as sovereignty in her visits, and twice as welcome. Her gifts are infinitely more worth having.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"What sort of gifts?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"The family fortune. She invariably restores the family fortune. That's why we put you here, to tempt her.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"What temptation should&nbsp;<em>I</em>&nbsp;be?&mdash;especially to restoring your family fortunes. I didn't think they needed it, anyhow.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Well!\" he hesitated. \"Not exactly in money: we can manage modestly that way; but in everything else but money&mdash;&mdash;\"</p>\r\n<p>There was a pause. I was thinking of Carlotta's \"luck for two.\" Poor Carlotta! She looked worn now. Especially her chin looked worn, showing the edge of the jaw. She had sat herself down in a chair by the fire, and put her feet on the stone fender, and was leaning forward, screening her face with her hand, still careful of her complexion. I could see her broad, white shoulders, showing the shoulder-blades, as she leaned forward, beneath her dress. But it was as if some bitterness had soaked all the life out of her, and she was only weary, or inert, drained of her feelings. It grieved me, and the thought passed through my mind that a man should take her in his arms and cherish her body, and start her flame again. If she would let him, which was doubtful.</p>\r\n<p>Her courage was fallen, in her body; only her spirit fought on. She would have to restore the body of her life, and only a living body could do it.</p>\r\n<p>\"What&nbsp;<em>about</em>&nbsp;your ghost?\" I said to him. \"Is she really ghastly?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Not at all!\" he said. \"She's supposed to be lovely. But I have no experience, and I don't know anybody who has. We hoped you'd come, though, and tempt her. Mother had a message about you, you know.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"No, I didn't know.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Oh, yes! When you were still in Africa. The medium said: 'There is a man in Africa. I can only see M, a double M. He is thinking of your family. It would be good if he entered your family.' Mother was awfully puzzled, but Carlotta said 'Mark Morier' at once.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"That's not why I asked you down,\" said Carlotta quickly, looking round, shading her eyes with her hand as she looked at me.</p>\r\n<p>I laughed, saying nothing.</p>\r\n<p>\"But, of course,\" continued Lord Lathkill, \"you&nbsp;<em>needn't</em>&nbsp;have this room. We have another one ready as well. Would you like to see it?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"How does your ghost manifest herself?\" I said, parrying.</p>\r\n<p>\"Well, I hardly know. She seems to be a very grateful&nbsp;<em>presence</em>, and that's about all I do know. She was apparently quite&nbsp;<em>persona grata</em>&nbsp;to everyone she visited. Gratissima, apparently!\"</p>\r\n<p>\"<em>Benissimo</em>!\" said I.</p>\r\n<p>A servant appeared in the doorway, murmuring something I could not hear. Everybody in the house, except Carlotta and Lord Lathkill, seemed to murmur under their breath.</p>\r\n<p>\"What's she say?\" I asked.</p>\r\n<p>\"If you will stay in this room? I told her you might like a room on the front. And if you'll take a bath?\" said Carlotta.</p>\r\n<p>\"Yes!\" said I. And Carlotta repeated to the maid-servant.</p>\r\n<p>\"And for heaven's sake speak to me loudly,\" said I to that elderly correct female in her starched collar, in the doorway.</p>\r\n<p>\"Very good, sir!\" she piped up. \"And shall I make the bath hot, or medium?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Hot!\" said I, like a cannon-shot.</p>\r\n<p>\"Very good, sir!\" she piped up again, and her elderly eyes twinkled as she turned and disappeared.</p>\r\n<p>Carlotta laughed, and I sighed.</p>\r\n<p>We were six at table. The pink Colonel with the yellow creases under his blue eyes sat opposite me, like an old boy with a liver. Next him sat Lady Lathkill, watching from her distance. Her pink, soft old face, naked-seeming, with its pin-point blue eyes, was a real modern witch-face.</p>\r\n<p>Next me, on my left, was the dark young woman, whose slim, swarthy arms had an indiscernible down on them. She had a blackish neck, and her expressionless yellow-brown eyes said nothing, under level black brows. She was inaccessible. I made some remarks, without result. Then I said:</p>\r\n<p>\"I didn't hear your name when Lady Lathkill introduced me to you.\"</p>\r\n<p>Her yellow-brown eyes stared into mine for some moments before she said:</p>\r\n<p>\"Mrs. Hale!\" Then she glanced across the table. \"Colonel Hale is my husband.\"</p>\r\n<p>My face must have signalled my surprise. She stared into my eyes very curiously, with a significance I could not grasp, a long, hard stare. I looked at the bald, pink head of the Colonel bent over his soup, and I returned to my own soup.</p>\r\n<p>\"Did you have a good time in London?\" said Carlotta.</p>\r\n<p>\"No,\" said I. \"It was dismal.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Not a good word to say for it?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Not one.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"No nice people?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Not my sort of nice.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"What's your sort of nice?\" she asked, with a little laugh.</p>\r\n<p>The other people were stone. It was like talking into a chasm.</p>\r\n<p>\"Ah! If I knew myself, I'd look for them! But not sentimental, with a lot of soppy emotions on top, and nasty ones underneath.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Who are you thinking of?\" Carlotta looked up at me as the man brought the fish. She had a crushed sort of roguishness. The other diners were images.</p>\r\n<p>\"I? Nobody. Just everybody. No, I think I was thinking of the Obelisk Memorial Service.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Did you go to it?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"No, but I fell into it.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Wasn't it moving?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Rhubarb, senna, that kind of moving!\"</p>\r\n<p>She gave a little laugh, looking up into my face, from the fish.</p>\r\n<p>\"What was wrong with it?\"</p>\r\n<p>I noticed that the Colonel and Lady Lathkill each had a little dish of rice, no fish, and that they were served second&mdash;oh, humility!&mdash;and that neither took the white wine. No, they had no wine-glasses. The remoteness gathered about them, like the snows on Everest. The dowager peered across at me occasionally, like a white ermine out of the snow, and she had that cold air about her, of being good, and containing a secret of goodness: remotely, ponderously, fixedly knowing better. And I, with my chatter, was one of those fabulous fleas that are said to hop upon glaciers.</p>\r\n<p>\"Wrong with it?&nbsp;<em>It</em>&nbsp;was wrong, all wrong. In the rain, a soppy crowd, with soppy bare heads, soppy emotions, soppy chrysanthemums and prickly laurestinus! A steam of wet mob-emotions! Ah, no, it shouldn't be allowed.\"</p>\r\n<p>Carlotta's face had fallen. She again could feel death in her bowels, the kind of death the war signifies.</p>\r\n<p>\"Wouldn't you have us honour the dead?\" came Lady Lathkill's secretive voice across at me, as if a white ermine had barked.</p>\r\n<p>\"Honour the dead!\" My mind opened in amazement. \"Do you think they'd be honoured?\"</p>\r\n<p>I put the question in all sincerity.</p>\r\n<p>\"They would understand the&nbsp;<em>intention</em>&nbsp;was to honour them,\" came her reply.</p>\r\n<p>I felt astounded.</p>\r\n<p>\"If I were dead, would I be honoured if a great, steamy wet crowd came after me with soppy chrysanthemums and prickly laurestinus? Ugh! I'd run to the nethermost ends of Hades. Lord, how I'd run from them!\"</p>\r\n<p>The manservant gave us roast mutton, and Lady Lathkill and the Colonel chestnuts in sauce. Then he poured the burgundy. It was good wine. The pseudo-conversation was interrupted.</p>\r\n<p>Lady Lathkill ate in silence, like an ermine in the snow, feeding on his prey. Sometimes she looked round the table, her blue eyes peering fixedly, completely uncommunicative. She was very watchful to see that we were all properly attended to; \"The currant jelly for Mr. Morier,\" she would murmur, as if it were her table. Lord Lathkill, next her, ate in complete absence. Sometimes she murmured to him, and he murmured back, but I never could hear what they said. The Colonel swallowed the chestnuts in dejection, as if all were weary duty to him now. I put it down to his liver.</p>\r\n<p>It was an awful dinner-party. I never could hear a word anybody said, except Carlotta. They all let their words die in their throats, as if the larynx were the coffin of sound.</p>\r\n<p>Carlotta tried to keep her end up, the cheerful hostess sort of thing. But Lady Lathkill somehow, in silence and apparent humility, had stolen the authority that goes with the hostess, and she hung on to it grimly, like a white ermine sucking a rabbit. Carlotta kept glancing miserably at me, to see what I thought. I didn't think anything. I just felt frozen within the tomb. And I drank the good, good warm burgundy.</p>\r\n<p>\"Mr. Morier's glass!\" murmured Lady Lathkill, and her blue eyes with their black pin-points rested on mine a moment.</p>\r\n<p>\"Awfully nice to drink good burgundy!\" said I pleasantly.</p>\r\n<p>She bowed her head slightly, and murmured something inaudible.</p>\r\n<p>\"I beg your pardon?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Very glad you like it!\" she repeated, with distaste at having to say it again, out loud.</p>\r\n<p>\"Yes, I do. It's good.\"</p>\r\n<p>Mrs. Hale, who had sat tall and erect and alert, like a black she-fox, never making a sound, looked round at me to see what sort of specimen I was. She was just a bit intrigued.</p>\r\n<p>\"Yes, thanks,\" came a musical murmur from Lord Lathkill. \"I think I&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;take some more.\"</p>\r\n<p>The man, who had hesitated, filled his glass.</p>\r\n<p>\"I'm awfully sorry I can't drink wine,\" said Carlotta, absently. \"It has the wrong effect on me.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"I should say it has the wrong effect on everybody,\" said the Colonel, with an uneasy attempt to be there. \"But some people like the effect, and some don't.\"</p>\r\n<p>I looked at him in wonder. Why was he chipping in? He looked as if he'd liked the effect well enough, in his day.</p>\r\n<p>\"Oh, no!\" retorted Carlotta coldly. \"The effect on different people is quite different.\"</p>\r\n<p>She closed with finality, and a further frost fell on the table.</p>\r\n<p>\"Quite so,\" began the Colonel, trying, since he'd gone off the deep end, to keep afloat.</p>\r\n<p>But Carlotta turned abruptly to me.</p>\r\n<p>\"Why is it, do you think, that the effect is so different on different people?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"And on different occasions,\" said I, grinning through my burgundy. \"Do you know what they say? They say that alcohol, if it has an effect on your psyche, takes you back to old states of consciousness, and old reactions. But some people it doesn't stimulate at all, there is only a nervous reaction of repulsion.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"There's certainly a nervous reaction of repulsion in me,\" said Carlotta.</p>\r\n<p>\"As there is in all higher natures,\" murmured Lady Lathkill.</p>\r\n<p>\"Dogs hate whisky,\" said I.</p>\r\n<p>\"That's quite right,\" said the Colonel. \"Scared of it!\"</p>\r\n<p>\"I've often thought,\" said I, \"about those old states of consciousness. It's supposed to be an awful retrogression, reverting back to them. Myself, my desire to go onwards takes me back a little.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Where to?\" said Carlotta.</p>\r\n<p>\"Oh, I don't know! To where you feel a bit warm, and like smashing the glasses, don't you know?</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<div><span>J'avons bien bu et nous boirons!</span><span>Cassons les verres nous les payerons!</span><span>Compagnons! Voyez vous bien!</span><span>Voyez vous bien!</span><span>Voyez! voyez! voyez vous bien</span><span>Que les d'moiselles sont belles</span><span>O&ugrave; nous allons!\"</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>I had the effrontery to sing this verse of an old soldiers' song while Lady Lathkill was finishing her celery and nut salad. I sang it quite nicely, in a natty, well-balanced little voice, smiling all over my face meanwhile. The servant, as he went round for Lady Lathkill's plate, furtively fetched a look at me.&nbsp;<em>Look</em>! thought I.&nbsp;<em>You chicken that's come untrussed</em>!</p>\r\n<p>The partridges had gone, we had swallowed the&nbsp;<em>flan</em>, and were at dessert. They had accepted my song in complete silence. Even Carlotta! My&nbsp;<em>flan</em>&nbsp;had gone down in one gulp, like an oyster.</p>\r\n<p>\"You're quite right!\" said Lord Lathkill, amid the squashing of walnuts. \"I mean the state of mind of a Viking, shall we say, or of a Cataline conspirator, might be frightfully good for us, if we could re-capture it.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"A Viking!\" said I, stupefied. And Carlotta gave a wild snirt of laughter.</p>\r\n<p>\"Why not a Viking?\" he asked in all innocence.</p>\r\n<p>\"A Viking!\" I repeated, and swallowed my port. Then I looked round at my black-browed neighbour.</p>\r\n<p>\"Why do you never say anything?\" I asked.</p>\r\n<p>\"What should I say?\" she replied, frightened at the thought.</p>\r\n<p>I was finished. I gazed into my port as if expecting the ultimate revelation.</p>\r\n<p>Lady Lathkill rustled her finger-tips in the finger-bowl, and laid down her napkin decisively. The Colonel, old buck, rose at once to draw back her chair.&nbsp;<em>Place aux hommes</em>! I bowed to my neighbour, Mrs. Hale, a most disconcerting bow, and she made a circuit to get by me.</p>\r\n<p>\"You won't be awfully long?\" said Carlotta, looking at me with her slow, hazel-green eyes, between mischief and wistfulness and utter depression.</p>\r\n<p>Lady Lathkill steered heavily past me as if I didn't exist, perching rather forward, with her crest of white hair, from her big hips. She seemed abstracted, concentrated on something, as she went.</p>\r\n<p>I closed the door, and turned to the men.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<div><span>\"Dans la premi&egrave;re auberge</span><span><em>J'eus b'en bu</em>!\"</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>sang I in a little voice.</p>\r\n<p>\"Quite right,\" said Lord Lathkill. \"You're quite right.\"</p>\r\n<p>And we sent the port round.</p>\r\n<p>\"This house,\" I said, \"needs a sort of Spring cleaning.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"You're quite right,\" said Lord Lathkill.</p>\r\n<p>\"There's a bit of a dead smell!\" said I. \"We need Bacchus, and Eros, to sweeten it up, to freshen it.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"You think Bacchus and Eros?\" said Lord Lathkill, with complete seriousness; as if one might have telephoned for them.</p>\r\n<p>\"In the best sense,\" said I. As if we were going to get them from Fortnum and Mason's, at least.</p>\r\n<p>\"What exactly is the best sense?\" asked Lord Lathkill.</p>\r\n<p>\"Ah! The flame of life! There's a dead smell here.\"</p>\r\n<p>The Colonel fingered his glass with thick, inert fingers, uneasily.</p>\r\n<p>\"Do you think so?\" he said, looking up at me heavily.</p>\r\n<p>\"Don't you?\"</p>\r\n<p>He gazed at me with blank, glazed blue eyes, that had deathly yellow stains underneath. Something was wrong with him, some sort of breakdown. He should have been a fat, healthy, jolly old boy. Not very old either: probably not quite sixty. But with this collapse on him, he seemed, somehow, to smell.</p>\r\n<p>\"You know,\" he said, staring at me with a sort of gruesome challenge, then looking down at his wine, \"there's more things than we're aware of, happening to us!\" He looked up at me again, shutting his full lips under his little grey moustache, and gazing with a glazed defiance.</p>\r\n<p>\"Quite!\" said I.</p>\r\n<p>He continued to gaze at me with glazed, gruesome defiance.</p>\r\n<p>\"Ha!\" He made a sudden movement, and seemed to break up, collapse and become brokenly natural. \"There, you've said it. I married my wife when I was a kid of twenty.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Mrs. Hale?\" I exclaimed.</p>\r\n<p>\"Not this one\"&mdash;he jerked his head towards the door&mdash;\"my first wife.\" There was a pause; he looked at me with shamed eyes, then turned his wine-glass round and his head dropped. Staring at his twisting glass, he continued: \"I married her when I was twenty, and she was twenty-eight. You might say, she married me. Well, there it was! We had three children&mdash;I've got three married daughters&mdash;and we got on all right. I suppose she mothered me, in a way. And I never thought a thing. I was content enough, wasn't tied to her apron strings, and she never asked questions. She was always fond of me, and I took it for granted. I took it for granted. Even when she died&mdash;I was away in Salonika&mdash;I took it for granted, if you understand me. It was part of the rest of things&mdash;war&mdash;life&mdash;death. I knew I should feel lonely when I got back. Well, then I got buried&mdash;shell dropped, and the dug-out caved in&mdash;and that queered me. They sent me home. And the minute I saw the Lizard light&mdash;it was evening when we got up out of the Bay&mdash;I realised that Lucy had been waiting for me. I could feel her there, at my side, more plainly than I feel you now. And do you know, at that moment I woke up to her, and she made an awful impression on me. She seemed, if you get me, tremendously powerful, important; everything else dwindled away. There was the Lizard light blinking a long way off, and that meant home. And all the rest was my wife, Lucy: as if her skirts filled all the darkness. In a way, I was frightened; but that was because I couldn't quite get myself into line. I felt:&nbsp;<em>Good God</em>!&nbsp;<em>I never knew her</em>! And she was this tremendous thing! I felt like a child, and as weak as a kitten. And, believe me or not, from that day to this she's never left me. I know quite well she can hear what I'm saying. But she'll let me tell you. I knew that at dinner-time.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"But what made you marry again?\" I said.</p>\r\n<p>\"She made me!\" He went a trifle yellow on his cheek-bones. \"I could feel her telling me, '<em>Marry</em>!&nbsp;<em>Marry</em>!' Lady Lathkill had messages from her too; she was her great friend in life. I didn't think of marrying. But Lady Lathkill had the same message, that I must marry. Then a medium described the girl, in detail: my present wife. I knew her at once, friend of my daughters. After that the messages became more insistent, waking me three and four times in the night. Lady Lathkill urged me to propose, and I did it, and was accepted. My present wife was just twenty-eight, the age Lucy had been&mdash;&mdash;\"</p>\r\n<p>\"How long ago did you marry the present Mrs. Hale?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"A little over a year ago. Well, I thought I had done what was required of me. But directly after the wedding, such a state of terror came over me&mdash;perfectly unreasonable&mdash;I became almost unconscious. My present wife asked the if I was ill, and I said I was. We got to Paris. I felt I was dying. But I said I was going out to see a doctor, and I found myself kneeling in a church. Then I found peace&mdash;and Lucy. She had her arms round me, and I was like a child at peace. I must have knelt there for a couple of hours, in Lucy's arms. I&nbsp;<em>never</em>&nbsp;felt like that when I was alive: why, I couldn't stand that sort of thing! It's all come on after&mdash;after&mdash;&mdash;And now, I daren't offend Lucy's spirit. If I do, I suffer tortures till I've made peace again, till she folds me in her arms. Then I can live. But she won't let me go near the present Mrs. Hale. I&mdash;I&mdash;I daren't go near her.\"</p>\r\n<p>He looked up at me with fear, and shame, and shameful secrecy, and a sort of gloating showing in his unmanned blue eyes. He had been talking as if in his sleep.</p>\r\n<p>\"Why did your dead wife urge you to marry again?\" I said.</p>\r\n<p>\"I don't know,\" he replied. \"I don't know. She was older than I was, and all the cleverness was on her side. She was a very clever woman, and I was never much in the intellectual line, myself. I just took it for granted she liked me. She never showed jealousy, but I think now, perhaps she was jealous all the time, and kept it under. I don't know. I think she never felt quite straight about having married me. It seems like that. As if she had something on her mind. Do you know, while she was alive, I never gave it a thought. And now I'm aware of nothing else but her. It's as if her spirit wanted to live in my body, or at any rate&mdash;I don't know&mdash;&mdash;\"</p>\r\n<p>His blue eyes were glazed, almost fishy, with fear and gloating shame. He had a short nose, and full, self-indulgent lips, and a once-comely chin. Eternally a careless boy of thirteen. But now, care had got him in decay.</p>\r\n<p>\"And what does your present wife say?\" I asked.</p>\r\n<p>He poured himself some more wine.</p>\r\n<p>\"Why,\" he replied, \"except for her, I shouldn't mind so much. She says nothing. Lady Lathkill has explained everything to her, and she agrees that&mdash;that&mdash;a spirit from the other side is more important than mere pleasure&mdash;you know what I mean. Lady Lathkill says that this is a preparation for my next incarnation, when I am going to serve Woman, and help Her to take Her place.\"</p>\r\n<p>He looked up again, trying to be proud in his shame.</p>\r\n<p>\"Well, what a damned curious story!\" exclaimed Lord Lathkill. \"Mother's idea for herself&mdash;she had it in a message too&mdash;is that she is coming on earth the next time to save the animals from the cruelty of man. That's why she hates meat at table, or anything that has to be killed.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"And does Lady Lathkill encourage you in this business with your dead wife?\" said I.</p>\r\n<p>\"Yes. She helps me. When I get as you might say at cross purposes with Lucy&mdash;with Lucy's spirit, that is&mdash;Lady Lathkill helps to put it right between us. Then I'm all right, when I know I'm loved.\"</p>\r\n<p>He looked at me stealthily, cunningly.</p>\r\n<p>\"Then you're all wrong,\" said I, \"surely.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"And do you mean to say,\" put in Lord Lathkill, \"that you don't live with the present Mrs. Hale at all? Do you mean to say you never&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;lived with her?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"I've got a higher claim on me,\" said the unhappy Colonel.</p>\r\n<p>\"My God!\" said Lord Lathkill.</p>\r\n<p>I looked in amazement: the sort of chap who picks up a woman and has a good time with her for a week, then goes home as nice as pie, and now look at him! It was obvious that he had a terror of his black-browed new wife, as well as of Lucy's spirit. A devil and a deep sea with a vengeance!</p>\r\n<p>\"A damned curious story!\" mused Lord Lathkill. \"I'm not so sure I like it. Something's wrong somewhere. We shall have to go upstairs.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Wrong!\" said I. \"Why, Colonel, don't you turn round and quarrel with the spirit of your first wife, fatally and finally, and get rid of her?\"</p>\r\n<p>The Colonel looked at me, still diminished and afraid, but perking up a bit, as we rose from table.</p>\r\n<p>\"How would you go about it?\" he said.</p>\r\n<p>\"I'd just face her, wherever she seemed to be, and say: '<em>Lucy, go to Blazes</em>!'\"</p>\r\n<p>Lord Lathkill burst into a loud laugh, then was suddenly silent as the door noiselessly opened, and the dowager's white hair and pointed uncanny eyes peered in, then entered.</p>\r\n<p>\"I think I left my papers in here, Luke,\" she murmured.</p>\r\n<p>\"Yes, mother. There they are. We're just coming up.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Take your time.\"</p>\r\n<p>He held the door, and ducking forward, she went out again, clutching some papers. The Colonel had blenched yellow on his cheek-bones.</p>\r\n<p>We went upstairs to the small drawing-room.</p>\r\n<p>\"You were a long time,\" said Carlotta, looking in all our faces. \"Hope the coffee's not cold. We'll have fresh if it is.\"</p>\r\n<p>She poured out, and Mrs. Hale carried the cups. The dark young woman thrust out her straight, dusky arm, offering me sugar, and gazing at me with her unchanging, yellow-brown eyes. I looked back at her, and being clairvoyant in this house, was conscious of the curves of her erect body, the sparse black hairs there would be on her strong-skinned dusky thighs. She was a woman of thirty, and she had had a great dread, lest she should never marry. Now she was as if mesmerised.</p>\r\n<p>\"What do you do usually in the evenings?\" I said.</p>\r\n<p>She turned to me as if startled, as she nearly always did when addressed.</p>\r\n<p>\"We do nothing,\" she replied. \"Talk; and sometimes Lady Lathkill reads.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"What does she read?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"About spiritualism.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Sounds pretty dull.\"</p>\r\n<p>She looked at me again, but she did not answer. It was difficult to get anything out of her. She put up no fight, only remained in the same swarthy, passive, negative resistance. For a moment I wondered that no men made love to her: it was obvious they didn't. But then, modern young men are accustomed to being attracted, flattered, impressed: they expect an effort to please. And Mrs. Hale made none: didn't know how. Which for me was her mystery. She was passive, static, locked up in a resistant passivity that had fire beneath it.</p>\r\n<p>Lord Lathkill came and sat by us. The Colonel's confession had had an effect on him.</p>\r\n<p>\"I'm afraid,\" he said to Mrs. Hale, \"you have a thin time here.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Why?\" she asked.</p>\r\n<p>\"Oh, there is so little to amuse you. Do you like to dance?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Yes,\" she said.</p>\r\n<p>\"Well, then,\" he said, \"let us go downstairs and dance to the Victrola. There are four of us. You'll come, of course?\" he said to me.</p>\r\n<p>Then he turned to his mother.</p>\r\n<p>\"Mother, we shall go down to the morning-room and dance. Will you come too? Will you. Colonel?\"</p>\r\n<p>The dowager gazed at her son.</p>\r\n<p>\"I will come and look on,\" she said.</p>\r\n<p>\"And I will play the pianola, if you like,\" volunteered the Colonel.</p>\r\n<p>We went down, and pushed aside the chintz chairs and the rugs. Lady Lathkill sat in a chair, the Colonel worked away at the pianola. I danced with Carlotta, Lord Lathkill with Mrs. Hale.</p>\r\n<p>A quiet soothing came over me, dancing with Carlotta. She was very still and remote, and she hardly looked at me. Yet the touch of her was wonderful, like a flower that yields itself to the morning. Her warm, silken shoulder was soft and grateful under my hand, as if it knew me with that second knowledge which is part of one's childhood, and which so rarely blossoms again in manhood and womanhood. It was as if we had known each other perfectly, as children, and now, as man and woman, met in the full, further sympathy. Perhaps, in modern people, only after long suffering and defeat, can the naked intuition break free between woman and man.</p>\r\n<p>She, I knew, let the strain and the tension of all her life depart from her then, leaving her nakedly still, within my arm. And I only wanted to be with her, to have her in my touch.</p>\r\n<p>Yet after the second dance she looked at me, and suggested that she should dance with her husband. So I found myself with the strong, passive shoulder of Mrs. Hale under my hand, and her inert hand in mine, as I looked down at her dusky, dirty-looking neck&mdash;she wisely avoided powder. The duskiness of her mesmerised body made me see the faint dark sheen of her thighs, with intermittent black hairs. It was as if they shone through the silk of her mauve dress, like the limbs of a half-wild animal, that is locked up in its own helpless dumb winter, a prisoner.</p>\r\n<p>She knew, with the heavy intuition of her sort, that I glimpsed her crude among the bushes, and felt her attraction. But she kept looking away over my shoulder, with her yellow eyes, towards Lord Lathkill.</p>\r\n<p>Myself or him, it was a question of which got there first. But she preferred him. Only for some things she would rather it were me.</p>\r\n<p>Luke had changed curiously. His body seemed to have come alive, in the dark cloth of his evening suit; his eyes had a devil-may-care light in them, his long cheeks a touch of scarlet, and his black hair felt loose over his forehead. He had again some of that Guardsman's sense of well-being and claim to the best in life, which I had noticed the first time I saw him. But now it was a little more florid, defiant, with a touch of madness.</p>\r\n<p>He looked down at Carlotta with uncanny kindness and affection. Yet he was glad to hand her over to me. He, too, was afraid of her: as if with her his bad luck had worked. Whereas, in a throb of crude brutality, he felt it would not work with the dark young woman. So, he handed Carlotta over to me with relief, as if, with me, she would be safe from the doom of his bad luck. And he, with the other woman, would be safe from it too. For the other woman was outside the circle.</p>\r\n<p>I was glad to have Carlotta again: to have that inexpressible delicate and complete quiet of the two of us, resting my heart in a balance now at last physical as well as spiritual. Till now, it had always been a fragmentary thing. Now, for this hour at least, it was whole, a soft, complete, physical flow, and a unison deeper even than childhood.</p>\r\n<p>As she danced she shivered slightly, and I seemed to smell frost in the air. The Colonel, too, was not keeping the rhythm.</p>\r\n<p>\"Has it turned colder?\" I said.</p>\r\n<p>\"I wonder!\" she answered, looking up at me with a slow beseeching. Why, and for what was she beseeching me? I pressed my hand a little closer, and her small breasts seemed to speak to me. The Colonel recovered the rhythm again.</p>\r\n<p>But at the end of the dance she shivered again, and it seemed to me I too was chilled.</p>\r\n<p>\"Has it suddenly turned colder?\" I said, going to the radiator. It was quite hot.</p>\r\n<p>\"It seems to me it has,\" said Lord Lathkill, in a queer voice.</p>\r\n<p>The Colonel was sitting abjectly on the music stool, as if broken.</p>\r\n<p>\"Shall we have another? Shall we try a tango?\" said Lord Lathkill. \"As much of it as we can manage?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;\" the Colonel began, turning round on the seat, his face yellow. \"I'm not sure&mdash;&mdash;\"</p>\r\n<p>Carlotta shivered. The frost seemed to touch my vitals. Mrs. Hale stood stiff, like a pillar of brown rock-salt, staring at her husband.</p>\r\n<p>\"We had better leave off,\" murmured Lady Lathkill, rising.</p>\r\n<p>Then she did an extraordinary thing. She lifted her face, staring to the other side, and said suddenly, in a clear, cruel sort of voice:</p>\r\n<p>\"Are you here, Lucy?\"</p>\r\n<p>She was speaking across to the spirits. Deep inside me leaped a jump of laughter. I wanted to howl with laughter. Then instantly, I went inert again. The chill gloom seemed to deepen suddenly in the room, everybody was overcome. On the piano-seat the Colonel sat yellow and huddled, with a terrible hang-dog look of guilt on his face. There was a silence, in which the cold seemed to creak. Then came again the peculiar bell-like ringing of Lady Lath kill's voice:</p>\r\n<p>\"Are you here? What do you wish us to do?\"</p>\r\n<p>A dead and ghastly silence, in which we all remained transfixed. Then from somewhere came two slow thuds, and a sound of drapery moving. The Colonel, with mad fear in his eyes, looked round at the uncurtained windows, and crouched on his seat.</p>\r\n<p>\"We must leave this room,\" said Lady Lathkill.</p>\r\n<p>\"I'll tell you what. Mother,\" said Lord Lathkill curiously; \"you and the Colonel go up, and we'll just turn on the Victrola.\"</p>\r\n<p>That was almost uncanny of him. For myself, the cold effluence of these people had paralysed me. Now I began to rally. I felt that Lord Lathkill was sane, it was these other people who were mad.</p>\r\n<p>Again from somewhere indefinite came two slow thuds.</p>\r\n<p>\"We must leave this room,\" repeated Lady Lathkill in monotony.</p>\r\n<p>\"All right. Mother. You go. I'll just turn on the Victrola.\"</p>\r\n<p>And Lord Lathkill strode across the room. In another moment the monstrous barking howl of the opening of a jazz tune, an event far more extraordinary than thuds, poured from the unmoving bit of furniture called a Victrola.</p>\r\n<p>Lady Lathkill silently departed. The Colonel got to his feet.</p>\r\n<p>\"I wouldn't go if I were you. Colonel,\" said I. \"Why not dance? I'll look on this time.\"</p>\r\n<p>I felt as if I were resisting a rushing, cold dark current.</p>\r\n<p>Lord Lathkill was already dancing with Mrs. Hale, skating delicately along, with a certain smile of obstinacy, secrecy, and excitement kindled on his face. Carlotta went up quietly to the Colonel, and put her hand on his broad shoulder. He let himself be moved into the dance, but he had no heart in it.</p>\r\n<p>There came a heavy crash, out of the distance. The Colonel stopped as if shot: in another moment he would go down on his knees. And his face was terrible. It was obvious he really felt another presence, other than ours, blotting us out. The room seemed dree and cold. It was heavy work, bearing up.</p>\r\n<p>The Colonel's lips were moving, but no sound came forth. Then, absolutely oblivious of us, he went out of the room.</p>\r\n<p>The Victrola had run down. Lord Lathkill went to wind it up again, saying:</p>\r\n<p>\"I suppose mother knocked over a piece of furniture.\"</p>\r\n<p>But we were all of us depressed, in abject depression.</p>\r\n<p>\"Isn't it awful!\" Carlotta said to me, looking up beseechingly.</p>\r\n<p>\"Abominable!\" said I.</p>\r\n<p>\"What do you think there is in it?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"God knows. The only thing is to stop it, as one does hysteria. It's on a par with hysteria.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Quite,\" she said.</p>\r\n<p>Lord Lathkill was dancing, and smiling very curiously down into his partner's face. The Victrola was at its loudest.</p>\r\n<p>Carlotta and I looked at one another, with hardly the heart to start again. The house felt hollow and gruesome. One wanted to get out, to get away from the cold, uncanny blight which filled the air.</p>\r\n<p>\"Oh, I say, keep the ball rolling,\" called Lord Lathkill.</p>\r\n<p>\"Come,\" I said to Carlotta.</p>\r\n<p>Even then she hung back a little. If she had not suffered, and lost so much, she would have gone upstairs at once to struggle in the silent wrestling of wills with her mother-in-law. Even now,&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;particular fight drew her, almost the strongest. But I took her hand.</p>\r\n<p>\"Come,\" I said. \"Let us dance it down. We'll roll the ball the opposite way.\"</p>\r\n<p>She danced with me, but she was absent, unwilling. The empty gloom of the house, the sense of cold, and of deadening opposition, pressed us down. I was looking back over my life, and thinking how the cold weight of an unliving spirit was slowly crushing all warmth and vitality out of everything. Even Carlotta herself had gone numb again, cold and resistant even to me. The thing seemed to happen wholesale in her.</p>\r\n<p>\"One has to choose to live,\" I said, dancing on.</p>\r\n<p>But I was powerless. With a woman, when her spirit goes inert in opposition, a man can do nothing. I felt my life-flow sinking in my body.</p>\r\n<p>\"This house is awfully depressing,\" I said to her, as we mechanically danced. \"Why don't you&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;something? Why don't you get out of this tangle? Why don't you break it?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"How?\" she said.</p>\r\n<p>I looked down at her, wondering why she was suddenly hostile.</p>\r\n<p>\"You needn't fight,\" I said. \"You needn't fight it. Don't get tangled up in it. Just side-step, on to another ground.\"</p>\r\n<p>She made a pause of impatience before she replied:</p>\r\n<p>\"I don't see where I am to side-step to, precisely.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"You do,\" said I. \"A little while ago, you were warm and unfolded and good. Now you are shut up and prickly, in the cold. You needn't be. Why not stay warm?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"It's nothing I do,\" she said coldly.</p>\r\n<p>\"It is. Stay warm to me. I am here. Why clutch in a tug-of-war with Lady Lathkill?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Do I clutch in a tug-of-war with my mother-in-law?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"You know you do.\"</p>\r\n<p>She looked up at me, with a faint little shadow of guilt and beseeching, but with a&nbsp;<em>moue</em>&nbsp;of cold obstinacy dominant.</p>\r\n<p>\"Let's have done,\" said I.</p>\r\n<p>And in cold silence we sat side by side on the lounge.</p>\r\n<p>The other two danced on. They at any rate were in unison. One could see from the swing of their limbs. Mrs. Hale's yellow-brown eyes looked at me every time she came round.</p>\r\n<p>\"Why does she look at me?\" I said.</p>\r\n<p>\"I can't imagine,\" said Carlotta, with a cold grimace.</p>\r\n<p>\"I'd better go upstairs and see what's happening,\" she said, suddenly rising and disappearing in a breath.</p>\r\n<p>Why should she go? Why should she rush off to the battle of wills with her mother-in-law? In such a battle, while one has any life to lose, one can only lose it. There is nothing positively to be done, but to withdraw out of the hateful tension.</p>\r\n<p>The music ran down. Lord Lathkill stopped the Victrola.</p>\r\n<p>\"Carlotta gone?\" he said.</p>\r\n<p>\"Apparently.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Why didn't you stop her?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Wild horses wouldn't stop her.\"</p>\r\n<p>He lifted his hand with a mocking gesture of helplessness.</p>\r\n<p>\"The lady loves her will,\" he said. \"Would you like to dance?\"</p>\r\n<p>I looked at Mrs. Hale.</p>\r\n<p>\"No,\" I said. \"I won't butt in. I'll play the pianola. The Victrola's a brute.\"</p>\r\n<p>I hardly noticed the passage of time. Whether the others danced or not, I played, and was unconscious of almost everything. In the midst of one rattling piece. Lord Lathkill touched my arm.</p>\r\n<p>\"Listen to Carlotta. She says closing time,\" he said, in his old musical voice, but with the sardonic ring of war in it now.</p>\r\n<p>Carlotta stood with her arms dangling, looking like a penitent schoolgirl.</p>\r\n<p>\"The Colonel has gone to bed. He hasn't been able to manage a reconciliation with Lucy,\" she said. \"My mother-in-law thinks we ought to let him try to sleep.\"</p>\r\n<p>Carlotta's slow eyes rested on mine, questioning, penitent&mdash;or so I imagined&mdash;and somewhat sphinx-like.</p>\r\n<p>\"Why, of course,\" said Lord Lathkill. \"I wish him all the sleep in the world.\"</p>\r\n<p>Mrs. Hale said never a word.</p>\r\n<p>\"Is Mother retiring too?\" asked Luke.</p>\r\n<p>\"I think so.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Ah! then supposing we go up and look at the supper-tray.\"</p>\r\n<p>We found Lady Lathkill mixing herself some night-cap brew over a spirit-lamp: something milky and excessively harmless. She stood at the sideboard stirring her potations, and hardly noticed us. When she had finished she sat down with her steaming cup.</p>\r\n<p>\"Colonel Hale all right, Mother?\" said Luke, looking across at her.</p>\r\n<p>The dowager, under her uplift of white hair, stared back at her son. There was an eye-battle for some moments, during which he maintained his arch, debonair ease, just a bit crazy.</p>\r\n<p>\"No,\" said Lady Lathkill, \"he is in great trouble.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Ah!\" replied her son. \"Awful pity we can't do anything for him. But if flesh and blood can't help him, I'm afraid I'm a dud. Suppose he didn't mind our dancing? Frightfully good for&nbsp;<em>us</em>! We've been forgetting that we're flesh and blood. Mother.\"</p>\r\n<p>He took another whisky and soda, and gave me one. And in a paralysing silence Lady Lathkill sipped her hot brew, Luke and I sipped our whiskies, the young woman ate a little sandwich. We all preserved an extraordinary aplomb, and an obstinate silence.</p>\r\n<p>It was Lady Lathkill who broke it. She seemed to be sinking downwards, crouching into herself like a skulking animal.</p>\r\n<p>\"I suppose,\" she said, \"we shall all go to bed?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"You go, Mother. We'll come along in a moment.\"</p>\r\n<p>She went, and for some time we four sat silent. The room seemed to become pleasanter, the air was more grateful.</p>\r\n<p>\"Look here,\" said Lord Lathkill at last. \"What do you think of this ghost business?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"I?\" said I. \"I don't like the atmosphere it produces. There may be ghosts, and spirits, and all that. The dead must be somewhere; there's no such place as nowhere. But they don't affect me particularly. Do they you?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Well,\" he said, \"no, not directly. Indirectly I suppose it does.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"I think it makes a horribly depressing atmosphere, spiritualism,\" said I. \"I want to kick.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Exactly! And ought one?\" he asked in his terribly sane-seeming way.</p>\r\n<p>This made me laugh. I knew what he was up to.</p>\r\n<p>\"I don't know what you mean by&nbsp;<em>ought</em>,\" said I. \"If I really want to kick, if I know I can't stand a thing, I kick. Who's going to authorise me, if my own genuine feeling doesn't?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Quite,\" he said, staring at me like an owl, with a fixed, meditative stare.</p>\r\n<p>\"Do you know,\" he said, \"I suddenly thought at dinner-time, what corpses we all were, sitting eating our dinners. I thought it when I saw you look at those little Jerusalem artichoke things in a white sauce. Suddenly it struck me, you were alive and twinkling, and we were all bodily dead. Bodily dead, if you understand. Quite alive in other directions, but bodily dead. And whether we ate vegetarian or meat made no difference. We were bodily dead.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Ah, with a slap in the face,\" said I, \"we come to life! You or I or anybody.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"I&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;understand poor Lucy,\" said Luke. \"Don't you? She forgot to be flesh and blood while she was alive, and now she can't forgive herself, nor the Colonel. That must be pretty rough, you know, not to realise it till you're dead, and you haven't, so to speak, anything left to go on. I mean it's awfully important to be flesh and blood.\"</p>\r\n<p>He looked so solemnly at us, we three broke simultaneously into an uneasy laugh.</p>\r\n<p>\"Oh, but I&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;mean it,\" he said. \"I've only realised how very extraordinary it is to be a man of flesh and blood, alive. It seems so ordinary, in comparison, to be dead, and merely spirit. That seems so commonplace. But fancy having a living face, and arms, and thighs. Oh, my God, I'm glad I've realised in time!\"</p>\r\n<p>He caught Mrs. Hale's hand, and pressed her dusky arm against his body.</p>\r\n<p>\"Oh, but if one had died without realising it!\" he cried. \"Think how ghastly for Jesus, when he was risen and wasn't touchable! How very awful, to have to say&nbsp;<em>Noli me tangere</em>! Ah, touch me, touch me&nbsp;<em>alive</em>!\"</p>\r\n<p>He pressed Mrs. Hale's hand convulsively against his breast. The tears had already slowly gathered in Carlotta's eyes and were dropping on to her hands in her lap.</p>\r\n<p>\"Don't cry, Carlotta,\" he said. \"Really, don't. We haven't killed one another. We're too decent, after all. We've almost become two spirits side by side. We've almost become two ghosts to one another, wrestling. Oh, but I want you to get back your body, even if I can't give it you. I want my flesh and blood, Carlotta, and I want you to have yours. We've suffered so much the other way. And the children, it is as well they are dead. They were born of our will and our disembodiment. Oh, I feel like the Bible. Clothe me with flesh again, and wrap my bones with sinew, and let the fountain of blood cover me. My spirit is like a naked nerve on the air.\"</p>\r\n<p>Carlotta has ceased to weep. She sat with her head dropped, as if asleep. The rise and fall of her small, slack breasts was still heavy, but they were lifting on a heaving sea of rest. It was as if a slow, restful dawn were rising in her body, while she slept. So slack, so broken she sat, it occurred to me that in this crucifixion business the crucified does not put himself alone on the cross. The woman is nailed even more inexorably up, and crucified in the body even more cruelly.</p>\r\n<p>It is a monstrous thought. But the deed is even more monstrous. Oh, Jesus, didn't you know that you couldn't be crucified alone!&mdash;that the two thieves crucified along with you were the two women, your wife and your mother! You called them two thieves. But what would they call you, who had their women's bodies on the cross? The abominable trinity on Calvary!</p>\r\n<p>I felt an infinite tenderness for my dear Carlotta. She could not yet be touched. But my soul streamed to her like warm blood. So she sat slack and drooped, as if broken. But she was not broken. It was only the great release.</p>\r\n<p>Luke sat with the hand of the dark young woman pressed against his breast. His face was warm and fresh, but he too breathed heavily, and stared unseeing. Mrs. Hale sat at his side erect and mute. But she loved him, with erect, black-faced, remote power.</p>\r\n<p>\"Morier!\" said Luke to me. \"If you can help Carlotta, you will, won't you? I can't do any more for her now. We are in mortal fear of each other.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"As much as she'll let me,\" said I, looking at her drooping figure, that was built on such a strong frame.</p>\r\n<p>The fire rustled on the hearth as we sat in complete silence. How long it lasted I cannot say. Yet we were none of us startled when the door opened.</p>\r\n<p>It was the Colonel, in a handsome brocade dressing-gown, looking worried.</p>\r\n<p>Luke still held the dark young woman's hand clasped against his thigh. Mrs. Hale did not move.</p>\r\n<p>\"I thought you fellows might help me,\" said the Colonel, in a worried voice, as he closed the door.</p>\r\n<p>\"What is wrong, Colonel?\" said Luke.</p>\r\n<p>The Colonel looked at him, looked at the clasped hands of Luke and the dark young woman, looked at me, looked at Carlotta, without changing his expression of anxiety, fear, and misery. He didn't care about us.</p>\r\n<p>\"I can't sleep,\" he said. \"It's gone wrong again. My head feels as if there was a cold vacuum in it, and my heart beats, and something screws up inside me. I know it's Lucy. She hates me again. I can't stand it.\"</p>\r\n<p>He looked at us with eyes half glazed, obsessed. His face seemed as if the flesh were breaking under the skin, decomposing.</p>\r\n<p>\"Perhaps, poor thing,\" said Luke, whose madness seemed really sane this night, \"perhaps you hate&nbsp;<em>her</em>.\"</p>\r\n<p>Luke's strange concentration instantly made us feel a tension, as of hate, in the Colonel's body.</p>\r\n<p>\"I?\" The Colonel looked up sharply, like a culprit. \"I! I wouldn't say that, if I were you.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Perhaps that's what's the matter,\" said Luke, with mad, beautiful calm. \"Why can't you feel kindly towards her, poor thing! She must have been done out of a lot while she lived.\"</p>\r\n<p>It was as if he had one foot in life and one in death, and knew both sides. To us it was like madness.</p>\r\n<p>\"I&mdash;I!\" stammered the Colonel; and his face was a study. Expression after expression moved across it: of fear, repudiation, dismay, anger, repulsion, bewilderment, guilt. \"I was good to her.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Ah yes,\" said Luke. \"Perhaps&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;were good to her. But was your body good to poor Lucy's body, poor dead thing!\"</p>\r\n<p>He seemed to be better acquainted with the ghost than with us.</p>\r\n<p>The Colonel gazed blankly at Luke, and his eyes went up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down.</p>\r\n<p>\"My body!\" he said blankly.</p>\r\n<p>And he looked down amazedly at his little round stomach, under the silk gown, and his stout knee, in its blue-and-white pyjama.</p>\r\n<p>\"My body!\" he repeated blankly.</p>\r\n<p>\"Yes,\" said Luke. \"Don't you see, you may have been awfully good to her. But her poor woman's body, were you ever good to that?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"She had everything she wanted. She had three of my children,\" said the Colonel dazedly.</p>\r\n<p>\"Ah yes, that may easily be. But your body of a man, was it ever good to her body of a woman? That's the point. If you understand the marriage service: with my body I thee worship. That's the point. No getting away from it.\"</p>\r\n<p>The queerest of all accusing angels did Lord Lathkill make, as he sat there with the hand of the other man's wife clasped against his thigh. His face was fresh and na&iuml;ve, and the dark eyes were bright with a clairvoyant candour, that was like madness, and perhaps was supreme sanity.</p>\r\n<p>The Colonel was thinking back, and over his face a slow understanding was coming.</p>\r\n<p>\"It may be,\" he said. \"It may be. Perhaps, that way, I despised her. It may be, it may be.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"I know,\" said Luke. \"As if she weren't worth noticing, what you did to her. Haven't I done it myself? And don't I know now, it's a horrible thing to do, to oneself as much as to her? Her poor ghost, that ached, and never had a real body! It's not so easy to worship with the body. Ah, if the Church taught us&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;sacrament:&nbsp;<em>with my body I thee worship</em>! that would easily make up for any honouring and obeying the woman might do. But that's why she haunts you. You ignored and disliked her body, and she was only a living ghost. Now she wails in the afterworld, like a still-wincing nerve.\"</p>\r\n<p>The Colonel hung his head, slowly pondering. Pondering with all his body. His young wife watched the sunken, bald head in a kind of stupor. His day seemed so far from her day. Carlotta had lifted her face; she was beautiful again, with the tender before-dawn freshness of a new understanding.</p>\r\n<p>She was watching Luke, and it was obvious, he was another man to her. The man she knew, the Luke who was her husband, was gone, and this other strange, uncanny creature had taken his place. She was filled with wonder. Could one so change, as to become another creature entirely? Ah, if it were so! If she herself, as she knew herself, could cease to be! If that woman who was married to Luke, married to him in an intimacy of misfortune that was like a horror, could only cease to be, and let a new, delicately-wild Carlotta take her place!</p>\r\n<p>\"It may be,\" said the Colonel, lifting his head. \"It may be.\" There seemed to come a relief over his soul, as he realised. \"I didn't worship her with my body. I think maybe I worshipped other women that way; but maybe I never did. But I thought I was good to her. And I thought she didn't want it.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"It's no good thinking. We all want it,\" asserted Luke. \"And before we die, we know it. I say, before we die. It may be after. But everybody wants it, let them say and do what they will. Don't you agree, Morier?\"</p>\r\n<p>I was startled when he spoke to me. I had been thinking of Carlotta: how she was looking like a girl again, as she used to look at the Thwaite, when she painted cactuses-in-a-pot. Only now, a certain rigidity of the will had left her, so that she looked even younger than when I first knew her, having now a virginal, flower-like&nbsp;<em>stillness</em>&nbsp;which she had not had then. I had always believed that people could be born again: if they would only let themselves.</p>\r\n<p>\"I'm sure they do,\" I said to Luke.</p>\r\n<p>But I was thinking, if people were born again, the old circumstances would not fit the new body.</p>\r\n<p>\"What about yourself, Luke?\" said Carlotta abruptly.</p>\r\n<p>\"I!\" he exclaimed, and the scarlet showed in his cheek. \"I! I'm not fit to be spoken about. I've been moaning like the ghost of disembodiment myself, ever since I became a man.\"</p>\r\n<p>The Colonel said never a word. He hardly listened. He was pondering, pondering. In his way, he too was a brave man.</p>\r\n<p>\"I have an idea what you mean,\" he said. \"There's no denying it, I didn't like her body. And now, I suppose, it's too late.\"</p>\r\n<p>He looked up bleakly: in a way, willing to be condemned, since he knew vaguely that something was wrong. Anything better than the blind torture.</p>\r\n<p>\"Oh, I don't know,\" said Luke. \"Why don't you, even now, love her a little with your real heart? Poor disembodied thing! Why don't you take her to your warm heart, even now, and comfort her inside there. Why don't you be kind to her poor ghost, bodily?\"</p>\r\n<p>The Colonel did not answer. He was gazing fixedly at Luke. Then he turned, and dropped his head, alone in a deep silence. Then, deliberately, but not lifting his head, he pulled open his dressing-gown at the breast, unbuttoned the top of his pyjama jacket, and sat perfectly still, his breast showing white and very pure, so much younger and purer than his averted face. He breathed with difficulty, his white breast rising irregularly. But in the deep isolation where he was, slowly a gentleness of compassion came over him, moulding his elderly features with strange freshness, and softening his blue eye with a look it had never had before. Something of the tremulous gentleness of a young bridegroom had come upon him, in spite of his baldness, his silvery little moustache, the weary marks of his face.</p>\r\n<p>The passionate, compassionate soul stirred in him and was pure, his youth flowered over his face and eyes.</p>\r\n<p>We sat very still, moved also in the spirit of compassion. There seemed a presence in the air, almost a smell of blossom, as if time had opened and gave off the perfume of spring. The Colonel gazed in silence into space, his smooth white chest, with the few dark hairs, open and rising and sinking with life.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile his dark-faced young wife watched as if from afar. The youngness that was on him was not for her.</p>\r\n<p>I knew that Lady Lathkill would come. I could feel her far off in her room, stirring and sending forth her rays. Swiftly I steeled myself to be in readiness. When the door opened, I rose and walked across the room.</p>\r\n<p>She entered with characteristic noiselessness, peering in round the door, with her crest of white hair, before she ventured bodily in. The Colonel looked at her swiftly, and swiftly covered his breast, holding his hand at his bosom, clutching the silk of his robe.</p>\r\n<p>\"I was afraid,\" she murmured, \"that Colonel Hale might be in trouble.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"No,\" said I. \"We are all sitting very peacefully. There is no trouble.\"</p>\r\n<p>Lord Lathkill also rose.</p>\r\n<p>\"No trouble at all, I assure you. Mother!\" he said.</p>\r\n<p>Lady Lathkill glanced at us both, then turned heavily to the Colonel.</p>\r\n<p>\"She is unhappy to-night?\" she asked.</p>\r\n<p>The Colonel winced.</p>\r\n<p>\"No,\" he said hurriedly. \"No, I don't think so.\" He looked up at her with shy, wincing eyes.</p>\r\n<p>\"Tell me what I can do,\" she said in a very low tone, bending towards him.</p>\r\n<p>\"Our ghost is walking to-night. Mother,\" said Lord Lathkill. \"Haven't you felt the air of spring, and smelt the plum-blossom? Don't you feel us all young? Our ghost is walking, to bring Lucy home. The Colonel's breast is quite extraordinary, white as plum-blossom. Mother, younger-looking than mine, and he's already taken Lucy into his bosom, in his breast, where he breathes like the wind among trees. The Colonel's breast is white and extraordinarily beautiful. Mother, I don't wonder poor Lucy yearned for it, to go home into it at last. It's like going into an orchard of plum-blossom, for a ghost.\"</p>\r\n<p>His mother looked round at him, then back at the Colonel, who was still clutching his hand over his chest, as if protecting something.</p>\r\n<p>\"You see, I didn't understand where I'd been wrong,\" he said, looking up at her imploringly. \"I never realised that it was my body which had not been good to her.\"</p>\r\n<p>Lady Lathkill curved sideways to watch him. But her power was gone. His face had come smooth with the tender glow of compassionate life, that flowers again. She could not get at him.</p>\r\n<p>\"It's no good, Mother. You know our ghost is walking. She's supposed to be absolutely like a crocus, if you know what I mean: harbinger of spring in the earth. So it says in my great-grandfather's diary: for she rises with silence like a crocus at the feet, and violets in the hollows of the heart come out. For she is of the feet and the hands, the thighs and breast, the face and the all-concealing belly, and her name is silent, but her odour is of spring, and her contact is the all-in-all.\" He was quoting from his great-grandfather's diary, which only the sons of the family read. And as he quoted he rose curiously on his toes, and spread his fingers, bringing his hands together till the finger-tips touched. His father had done that before him, when he was deeply moved.</p>\r\n<p>Lady Lathkill sat down heavily in the chair next the Colonel.</p>\r\n<p>\"How do you feel?\" she asked him, in a secretive mutter.</p>\r\n<p>He looked round at her, with the large blue eyes of candour.</p>\r\n<p>\"I never knew what was wrong,\" he said, a little nervously. \"She only wanted to be looked after a bit, not to be a homeless, houseless ghost. It's all right! She's all right here.\" He pressed his clutched hand on his breast. \"It's all right; it's all right. She'll be all right now.\"</p>\r\n<p>He rose, a little fantastic in his brocade gown, but once more manly, candid and sober.</p>\r\n<p>\"With your permission,\" he said, \"I will retire.\"&mdash;He made a little bow.&mdash;\"I am glad you helped me. I didn't know&mdash;didn't know.\"</p>\r\n<p>But the change in him, and his secret wondering were so strong on him, he went out of the room scarcely being aware of us.</p>\r\n<p>Lord Lathkill threw up his arms, and stretched, quivering.</p>\r\n<p>\"Oh, pardon, pardon,\" he said, seeming, as he stretched, quivering, to grow bigger and almost splendid, sending out rays of fire to the dark young woman. \"Oh, Mother, thank you for my limbs, and my body! Oh, Mother, thank you for my knees and my shoulders at this moment! Oh, Mother, thank you that my body is straight and alive! Oh, Mother, torrents of spring, torrents of spring, whoever said that?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Don't you forget yourself, my boy?\" said his mother.</p>\r\n<p>\"Oh no, dear, no! Oh, Mother dear, a man has to be in love in his thighs, the way you ride a horse. Why don't we stay in love that way all our lives? Why do we turn into corpses with consciousness? Oh, Mother of my body, thank you for my body, you strange woman with white hair! I don't know much about you, but my body came from you, so thank you, my dear. I shall think of you to-night!\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Hadn't we better go?\" she said, beginning to tremble.</p>\r\n<p>\"Why, yes,\" he said, turning and looking strangely at the dark young woman. \"Yes, let us go; let us go!\"</p>\r\n<p>Carlotta gazed at him, then, with strange, heavy, searching look, at me. I smiled to her, and she looked away. The dark young woman looked over her shoulder as she went out. Lady Lathkill hurried past her son, with head ducked. But still he laid his hand on her shoulder, and she stopped dead.</p>\r\n<p>\"Good-night, Mother, Mother of my face and my thighs. Thank you for the night to come, dear. Mother of my body.\"</p>\r\n<p>She glanced up at him rapidly, nervously, then hurried away. He stared after her, then switched off the light.</p>\r\n<p>\"Funny old Mother!\" he said. \"I never realised before that she was the mother of my shoulders and my hips, as well as my brain. Mother of my thighs!\"</p>\r\n<p>He switched off some of the lights as we went, accompanying me to my room.</p>\r\n<p>\"You know,\" he said, \"I can understand that the Colonel is happy, now the forlorn ghost of Lucy is comforted in his heart. After all, he married her! And she must be content at last: he has a beautiful chest, don't you think? Together they will sleep well. And then he will begin to live the life of the living again. How friendly the house feels to-night! But, after all, it is my old home. And the smell of plum-blossom&mdash;don't you notice it? It is our ghost, in silence like a crocus. There, your fire has died down! But it's a nice room! I hope our ghost will come to you. I think she will. Don't speak to her. It makes her go away. She, too, is a ghost of silence. We talk far too much. But now I am going to be silent too, and a ghost of silence. Good-night!\"</p>\r\n<p>He closed the door softly and was gone. And softly, in silence, I took off my things. I was thinking of Carlotta, and a little sadly, perhaps, because of the power of circumstance over us. This night I could have worshipped her with my body, and she, perhaps, was stripped in the body to be worshipped. But it was not for me, at this hour, to fight against circumstances.</p>\r\n<p>I had fought too much, even against the most imposing circumstances, to use any more violence for love. Desire is a sacred thing, and should not be violated.</p>\r\n<p>\"Hush!\" I said to myself. \"I will sleep, and the ghost of my silence can go forth, in the subtle body of desire, to meet that which is coming to meet it. Let my ghost go forth, and let me not interfere. There are many intangible meetings, and unknown fulfilments of desire.\"</p>\r\n<p>So I went softly to sleep, as I wished to, without interfering with the warm, crocus-like ghost of my body.</p>\r\n<p>And I must have gone far, far down the intricate galleries of sleep, to the very heart of the world. For I know I passed on beyond the strata of images and words, beyond the iron veins of memory, and even the jewels of rest, to sink in the final dark like a fish, dumb, soundless, and imageless, yet alive and swimming.</p>\r\n<p>And at the very core of the deep night the ghost came to me, at the heart of the ocean of oblivion, which is also the heart of life. Beyond hearing, or even knowledge of contact, I met her and knew her. How I know it I don't know. Yet I know it with eyeless, wingless knowledge.</p>\r\n<p>For man in the body is formed through countless ages, and at the centre is the speck, or spark, upon which all his formation has taken place. It is even not himself, deep beyond his many depths. Deep from him calls to deep. And according as deep answers deep, man glistens and surpasses himself.</p>\r\n<p>Beyond all the pearly mufflings of consciousness, of age upon age of consciousness, deep calls yet to deep, and sometimes is answered. It is calling and answering, new-wakened God calling within the deep of a man, and new God calling answer from the other deep. And sometimes the other deep is a woman, as it was with me, when my ghost came.</p>\r\n<p>Women were not unknown to me. But never before had woman come, in the depths of night, to answer my deep with her deep. As the ghost came, came as a ghost of silence, still in the depth of sleep.</p>\r\n<p>I know she came. I know she came even as a woman, to my man. But the knowledge is darkly naked as the event. I only know, it was so. In the deep of sleep a call was called from the deeps of me, and answered in the deeps, by a woman among women. Breasts or thighs or face, I remember not a touch, no, nor a movement of my own. It is all complete in the profundity of darkness. Yet I know it was so.</p>\r\n<p>I awoke towards dawn, from far, far away. I was vaguely conscious of drawing nearer and nearer, as the sun must have been drawing towards the horizon, from the complete beyond. Till at last the faint pallor of mental consciousness coloured my waking.</p>\r\n<p>And then I was aware of a pervading scent, as of plum-blossom, and a sense of extraordinary silkiness&mdash;though where, and in what contact, I could not say. It was as the first blemish of dawn.</p>\r\n<p>And even with so slight a conscious registering,&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;seemed to disappear. Like a whale that has sounded to the bottomless seas. That knowledge of&nbsp;<em>it</em>, which was the marriage of the ghost and me, disappeared from me, in its rich weight of certainty, as the scent of the plum-blossom moved down the lanes of my consciousness, and my limbs stirred in a silkiness for which I have no comparison.</p>\r\n<p>As I became aware, I also became uncertain. I wanted to be certain of&nbsp;<em>it</em>, to have definite evidence. And as I sought for evidence,&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;disappeared, my perfect knowledge was gone. I no longer knew in full.</p>\r\n<p>Now as the daylight slowly amassed, in the windows from which I had put back the shutters, I sought in myself for evidence, and in the room.</p>\r\n<p>But I shall never know. I shall never know if it was a ghost, some sweet spirit from the innermost of the ever-deepening cosmos; or a woman, a very woman, as the silkiness of my limbs seems to attest; or a dream, a hallucination! I shall never know. Because I went away from Riddings in the morning, on account of the sudden illness of Lady Lathkill.</p>\r\n<p>\"You will come again,\" Luke said to me. \"And in any case, you will never really go away from us.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Good-bye,\" she said to me. \"At last it was perfect!\"</p>\r\n<p>She seemed so beautiful, when I left her, as if it were the ghost again, and I was far down the deeps of consciousness.</p>\r\n<p>The following autumn, when I was overseas once more, I had a letter from Lord Lathkill. He wrote very rarely.</p>\r\n<p>\"Carlotta has a son,\" he said, \"and I an heir. He has yellow hair, like a little crocus, and one of the young plum-trees in the orchard has come out of all season into blossom. To me he is flesh and blood of our ghost itself. Even mother doesn't look over the wall, to the other side, any more. It's all this side for her now.</p>\r\n<p>\"So our family refuses to die out, by the grace of our ghost. We are calling him Gabriel.</p>\r\n<p>\"Dorothy Hale also is a mother, three days before Carlotta. She has a black lamb of a daughter, called Gabrielle. By the bleat of the little thing, I know its father. Our own is a blue-eyed one, with the dangerous repose of a pugilist. I have no fears of our family misfortune for him, ghost-begotten and ready-fisted.</p>\r\n<p>\"The Colonel is very well, quiet and self-possessed. He is farming in Wiltshire, raising pigs. It is a passion with him, the cr&ecirc;me de la cr&ecirc;me of swine. I admit, he has golden sows as elegant as a young Diane de Poitiers, and young hogs like Perseus in the first red-gold flush of youth. He looks me in the eye, and I look him back, and we understand. He is quiet, and proud now, and very hale and hearty, raising swine&nbsp;<em>ad maiorem gloriam Dei</em>. A good sport!</p>\r\n<p>\"I am in love with this house and its inmates, including the plum-blossom-scented one, she who visited you, in all the peace. I cannot understand why you wander in uneasy and distant parts of the earth. For me, when I am at home, I am there. I have peace upon my bones, and if the world is going to come to a violent and untimely end, as prophets aver, I feel the house of Lathkill will survive, built upon our ghost. So come back, and you'll find we shall not have gone away....\"</p>",

  "contentText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nBy Thomas L. Masson\nManaging Editor of Life\n\nIt was at a luncheon party that the idea of Life’s Short Story Contest was first suggested by Mr. Lincoln Steffens. He propounded\nthis interesting query:\n\n> “How short can a short story be and still be a short story?”\n\nIt was thereupon determined to discover, if possible, a practical answer to this interesting question. The columns of Life were\nthrown open to contributors for many months, prizes aggregating $1,750 were offered and eighty-one short stories were published.\nThis book contains these stories, including the four prize winners.\n\nThe contest cost in round numbers a little less than $12,000. Over thirty thousand manuscripts were received. They came from all\nover the world—from sufferers on hospital cots, from literary toilers in the Philippines, from Europe, Asia, and Africa, and from\nevery State in the Union. One manuscript was sent from a trench at the French battle front, where the story had been written\nbetween hand grenades. Every kind of story was represented, the war story and the love story being the leaders. Every kind of\nwriting was represented, from the short compound of trite banalities to the terse, dramatic, carefully wrought out climax. Back of\nmany of these efforts the spectral forms of Guy de Maupassant and O. Henry hovered in sardonic triumph. Tragedy predominated. The\nlight touch was few and far between. But it was still there, as the stories published show.\n\nHere let me pay a just tribute to the readers who, with almost superhuman courage, struggled through these thirty thousand\nmanuscripts. In the beginning they were a noble band of highly intelligent and cultivated men and women, with strong\nconstitutions, ready and willing to face literature in any form. I understand that many of them survived the contest. This speaks\nwell for the virility of our American stock. Theirs was a noble and enduring toil, and theirs will be a noble and enduring fame.\nWithout them this book now might contain twenty-nine thousand nine hundred and eleven poor stories instead of eighty-one good\nones. To those among them who still live, a long life and, let us hope, an ultimate recovery!\n\nNaturally, in the method of securing the stories, there had to be some way of getting the contributors to make them as short as\npossible. Mr. Steffens’ ingenious suggestion admirably attained this end. First, a limit of fifteen hundred words was placed upon\nall stories submitted, no story longer than this being admitted to the contest. For each story accepted the contributor was paid,\nnot for what he wrote, but for what he did not write. That is to say, he was paid at the rate of ten cents a word for the\ndifference between what he wrote and fifteen hundred words. If his story, for example, happened to be 1,500 words in length, he\ngot nothing. If it was 1,490 words he got one dollar. If there had been a story only ten words long, the author would have\nreceived $149. To be accurate, the longest story actually accepted for the contest was 1,495 words, for which the author received\nfifty cents, and the shortest was 76 words, for which the author received $142.40. The interested reader will be able to discover\nthe identity of these two stories by examining the stories in the book. At the original luncheon party a large part of the warm\ndiscussion that took place turned on how short a story could be made and still come within the definition of a short story. It was\nreally a question as to when is a story not a story, but only an anecdote. When a story is a story, is it a combination of plot,\ncharacter, and setting or is it determined by only one of these three elements? Must it end when you have ended it or must it\nsuggest something beyond the reading? I shall not attempt to answer these questions. The definition of the short story should be\nrelegated to the realm of “What is Humor?” “Who is the mother of the chickens?” and “How Old is Ann?” If you really wish to vary\nthe monotony of your intellectual life and get it away from “Who Wrote Shakespeare?” or “Who killed Jack Robinson?” start a\ndiscussion as to what a short story is. It has long been my private opinion that the best short story in the world is the story of\nAli Baba and the Forty Thieves, but I have no doubt that, should I venture this assertion in the company of others, there would be\none to ask: “What has that to do with the price of oil now?”\n\nBut in order that the reader may have some idea of the method adopted in judging the stories which were finally selected, it may\nbe well to give what I may term a composite definition of what a short story is, gathered from the various opinions offered when\nthe contest was originally under discussion by the judges. This definition is not intended to be complete or final. It is not the\ncohesive opinion of one individual, but only a number of rather off-hand opinions which are of undoubted psychological interest as\nbearing upon the final decisions.\n\nA short story must contain at least two characters, for otherwise there would be no contrast or struggle. A situation must be\ndepicted in which there are two opposing forces.\n\nA short story must be a picture out of real life which gives the reader a definite sensation, such as he gets upon looking at a\nmasterpiece of painting. While it must be complete in itself, the art of it lies in what it suggests to the reader beyond its own\nlimits. That is to say, it must convey an idea much larger than itself. This is the open sesame to the golden principle. (This is\nwell illustrated in the story that took the first prize.)\n\nEvery short story must of necessity deal with human beings, either directly or indirectly. It must reveal in the briefest manner\npossible—as it were, like a lightning flash—a situation that carries the reader beyond it. It is, therefore, inevitable that the\nsupreme test of the short story lies in its climax. The climax must gather up everything that has gone before, and perhaps by only\none word epitomize the whole situation in such a way as to produce in the reader a sense of revelation—just as if he were the sole\nspectator of a supremely interesting human mystery now suddenly made plain.\n\nThe technique of the short story should be such that no word in its vocabulary will suggest triteness or the fatal thought that\nthe author is dependent upon others for his phrasing. When, for example, we read “With a glad cry she threw her arms about him” “A\nhoarse shout went up from the vast throng” “He flicked the ashes,” we know at once that the author is only dealing in echoes.\n\nThese were some of the general considerations which governed the readers and judges, but it would be unfair to say that there were\nnot other considerations which came up later on. In a number of instances, manuscripts which were interesting and well written,\nand even longer than others that were accepted for the contest, were rejected because it was felt that they were not really\nstories, but more in the nature of descriptive sketches.\n\nSo far as the practical method pursued was concerned, it will not be amiss to state briefly how the work was carried on.\n\nIt was deemed best, on general principles, to let the authors of the stories have a hand in the matter, the editors feeling\nfrankly that they preferred a disinterested method which would relieve them in a measure from the fullest responsibility. The\nconditions were therefore made to read that:\n\n> “The editors of ‘Life’ will first select out of all the stories published, the twelve which are, in their judgment, the best.\n> The authors of these twelve stories will then be asked to become judges of the whole contest, which will then include all the\n> stories published. These twelve authors will decide which are the best three stories, in the order of their merit, to be awarded\n> the prizes. In case for any reason any one or more of these twelve authors should be unable to act as a judge, then the contest\n> will be decided by the rest.\n> \n> “Each of these twelve judges will, of course, if he so wishes, vote for his own story first, so that the final result may\n> probably be determined by the combined second, third, and fourth choices of all the judges. This, however, will not affect the\n> result. In case of a division among the judges, the Editors of ‘Life’ will cast the deciding vote.”\n\nThis method worked well and was fully justified by the final result. As the manuscripts were received they were registered\naccording to a careful clerical system and turned over to the readers, who were from five to seven in number, including three\nwomen. The rule was that each story should be read independently by at least two readers, their verdicts separately recorded. If\nthey were unanimous in rejecting a story, it was returned. If they were agreed upon its merits, or if they were at all doubtful,\nit was then passed up to the five members of Life’s editorial staff. It was read and reread by them, and the individual comments\nof each editor recorded independently. By this sifting process, each story was subjected to a final process of discussion and\nelimination. The stories, as accepted, were paid for on the basis of ten cents a word for all the words under 1,500 which the\nstory did not contain and were published in Life. From the authors of the eighty-one stories published, the editors selected the\nfollowing twelve judges, each one of whom consented to serve:\n\n * Herbert Heron, Carmel, Cal.\n * J. H. Ranxom, Houston, Texas.\n * Ralph Henry Barbour, Manchester, Mass.\n * Clarence Herbert New, Brooklyn, N. Y.\n * William Johnston, New York City.\n * Graham Clark, New York City.\n * Mrs. Elsie D. Knisely, Everett, Wash.\n * Mrs. Jane Dahl, San Francisco, Cal.\n * Selwyn Grattan, New York City.\n * E. L. Smith, Ft. Worth, Texas.\n * Herbert Riley Howe, Sioux Falls, S. Dak.\n * Miss Ruth Sterry, Los Angeles, Cal.\n\nThese judges, independently of each other, sent in their opinions, several of them not voting for their own stories as the first\nprize, although this was allowable under the rules. There was no difficulty on their part in awarding the first prize of one\nthousand dollars and the second prize of five hundred dollars. In the case of the third prize there was such a division of opinion\nthat the editors, under the rule of the competition that gave them the final decision, determined that it would be fair to divide\nthe third prize between two competitors who had received the same number of the judges’ votes.\n\nThe prize winners were as follows:\n\nFIRST PRIZE Ralph Henry Barbour of Manchester, Mass., and George Randolph Osborne of Cambridge, Mass., joint authors of “Thicker\nThan Water.” SECOND PRIZE Harry Stillwell Edwards of Macon, Georgia, author of “The Answer.” THIRD PRIZE Dwight M. Wiley of\nPrinceton, Ill., author of “Her Memory,” and Redfield Ingalls of New York City, author of “Business and Ethics.” This prize was\ndivided.\n\nThis book is now offered to the public in the confident hope and the firm belief that it will be found a valuable contribution to\nthe literature of short fiction, in addition to the interest it also merits because of the stories themselves.\n\nOne final point should be emphasized. This book is not, in the very nature of the case, a book of uniform literary style; it is\nnot the polished expression of the highest literary art. It is the best of thirty thousand attempts to write a short story, by all\nsorts and conditions of minds—a fair proportion of them amateurs, a fair proportion writers of considerable experience, and a\nsmall proportion excellently skilled craftsmen. In their final selection of these stories, the readers and judges were governed,\nnot so much by the question “Is this superfine literary art?” as they were by the question “Is this interesting?” By this\ntouchstone the book certainly justifies its existence.\n\nT. L. M.\n\n\nN. B.\n\nBy Joseph Hall\n\nLieutenant Ludwig Kreusler glanced hurriedly through the mail that had accumulated during the month that the X-8 had been away\nfrom base. At the bottom of the pile he found the letter he had been seeking and his eyes brightened. It was a fat letter,\naddressed in feminine handwriting, and its original postmark was Washington, D. C., U. S. A.\n\n“His Excellency will see you, sir.” The orderly had entered quietly and stood at attention.\n\nWith a slightly impatient shrug the Lieutenant shoved the letters into his pocket and left the room.\n\nHe found Admiral Von Herpitz, the wizard of the sea, at his desk. As the young man entered the old Admiral rose and came forward.\nThis unusual mark of favour somewhat embarrassed the young officer until the old man, placing both huge hands upon his shoulders,\nlooked into his eyes.\n\n“Excellent.”\n\nThe one word conveyed a volume of praise, gratification. The old sea dog was known as a silent man. Censure was more frequent from\nhim than applause.\n\nThe Lieutenant could find no word. The situation was for him embarrassing in the extreme. He, like Herpitz, was a man of actions,\nand words confused him.\n\n“These English,” the old Admiral spoke grimly, “we will teach them. Have you seen the reports? They are having quite a little\npanic in America also over the Seronica. Two hundred of the passengers lost were American.”\n\nA file of papers lay on the table. Kreusler ran through them hurriedly. The Berlin journals gave the sinking of the Seronica great\nheadlines followed by columns of sheer joy. The London and Paris and some of the New York sheets called the exploit a crime and\nits perpetrators pirates. But they all gave it utter and undivided thought. The X-8 had become the horror craft of the world.\nBerlin figuratively carried her young commander on her shoulders. He found himself the hero of the hour.\n\n“You have done well for the Fatherland,” Von Herpitz repeated as the Lieutenant was going out.\n\nIn his own cabin Kreusler forgot the Seronica and the X-8. The fat letter with the Washington postmark absorbed him.\n\nTwo years, ending with the outbreak of the great war, Kreusler had been naval attaché to the German embassy at Washington. He had\nbeen popular in the society of the American capital. He was highly educated, a profound scientist, an original thinker, and an\nadaptable and interesting dinner guest. Dorothy Washburn, the youngest daughter of the Senator from Oregon, had made her début in\nWashington during the second winter of Kreusler’s presence there. The two had met. They were exact opposites; he tall, severe,\nblond, thoughtfully serious; she, small, dark, vivacious, bubbling with the joy of life. Love was inevitable.\n\nThe fat letter was engrossing. It breathed in every line and word and syllable the fine love this wonder woman gave him. One\nparagraph was most astounding. It read:\n\n“To be near thee, loved one, I have arranged, through the gracious kindness of our friends, to come to Berlin as a nurse. Just\nwhen is as yet uncertain, but come I will, fear not, as quickly as may be. Dost long for me, to see me, dearest heart, as I for\nthee? Well, soon perhaps that may not be so far away. Couldst not thou arrange to be wounded—only slightly, of course, my love—so\nthat I might attend thee?”\n\nThe letter ended with tender love messages and assurances of devotion. The last sheet bore a single word, “Over,” and on the\nreverse side a woman’s most important news, a postscript. This read:\n\n“P. S. Arrangements have been completed. Everything is settled. Even my father has consented, knowing of my great love. I sail\nnext week.”\n\nAnd then:\n\n“N. B. The ship on which I sail is the Seronica.”\n\n\nTHE CLEAREST CALL\n\nBy Brevard Mays Connor\n\n“Don’t worry,” said the great surgeon. “She will pull through. She has a fine constitution.”\n\n“She will pull through because you are handling the case,” the nurse murmured, with an admiring glance.\n\n“She will pull through,” agreed the Reverend Paul Templeton, “because I shall pray.”\n\nHe did not see the ironical glance which passed between nurse and doctor, materialists both. He had stooped and kissed his wife,\nwho lay on the wheeled table that was to carry her to the operating room. She was asleep, for the narcotic had taken immediate\neffect.\n\nFor a moment he hung over her and then he moved aside. When the door of the operating room had closed on the wheeled table with\nits sheeted burden he stepped out on the little upper balcony beneath the stars, knelt, and earnestly addressed himself to his\nMaker.\n\nA distant clock struck eight. The operation would take an hour....\n\nHumbly he prayed, but with superb confidence. He had lived a blameless life, and his efforts were in behalf of a life equally\nblameless. It was inconceivable that he who had given all and asked nothing should be refused this, his first request. It was even\nmore inconceivable that his wife, who was so worthy of pardon, should be condemned. Humbly he prayed, but not without assurance of\na friendly Auditor.\n\nIt was a sweet May night, satin-soft, blossom-scented. The south wind was whispering confidences to the elms; the stars were\nunutterably benign. Surely God was in His heaven, thought the Reverend Paul Templeton.\n\nThen up from the darkness beneath the trees came the low, thrilling laugh of a girl. He lifted his face from his hands and stared,\nscarce breathing, into the night, while his ears still held every note of that low, thrilling laugh, which spoke of youth in love\nin the springtime.\n\nThe black bulk of the hospital behind him faded into obscurity as swiftly as a scene struck on a darkened stage. He was no longer\non a little upper porch, but in an old-fashioned summer-house, hidden from the tactless moon by a mesh of honeysuckle in bloom. He\nwas no longer on his knees before his Maker, but sitting beside the girl who had been Ellen McCartney.\n\nShe was dressed in white. She was so close he could feel the warmth of her. Somehow, in that darkness, their hands met and clung,\nshoulder touched shoulder—the fragrance of her hair in his nostrils. The soft, womanly yielding of her body.\n\nNow her palms were resting against his cheeks, drawing his head down; now, as lightly as a butterfly upon a flower, her lips\nbrushed his one closed eye and then the other; now she laughed, a low, thrilling laugh, which spoke of youth in love in the\nspringtime.\n\nPrayer had gone dry at its source, choked by the luxuriant vegetation of memory. He remembered other kisses and thrilled in\nsympathy with the delight of other time....\n\nThe distant clock struck nine, but he did not hear it. The shriek of a woman in pain sliced through the silence but could not\npenetrate the walls of his dream. The girl who had been Ellen McCartney lay in his arms, her lips to his.\n\nThen a hand fell upon his shoulder.\n\n“Come,” said the nurse, and slipped back into the room.\n\nThe Reverend Paul Templeton came back with a wrench to consciousness of the time and place, and horror surged through his veins\nlike a burning poison. It was over—and he had not prayed! And worse! When his whole being should have been prostrate in humble\nsupplication he had allowed it to walk brazenly erect among memories that at the best were frivolous and at the worst—carnal! He\nseemed to hear a voice saying:\n\n“I am the Lord of Vengeance. Heavy is mine hand against them that slight Me!”\n\nMastered by despair, he clung to the iron railing. What could he hope of science when he had failed in his duty to faith? Somehow\nhe managed to struggle to his feet and gain the room.\n\nThe sheeted figure on the bed was very still, the face paler than the pillow on which it lay. He crumpled down beside her and hid\nhis face, too sick with shame to weep. He knew with a horrid certainty that she was dead and that he had killed her.\n\nAnd then:\n\n“Paul!”\n\nIt was the merest wisp of sound, almost too impalpable to be human utterance. He lifted his head and looked into the face of the\ngreat surgeon.... He was smiling.\n\n“Paul!”\n\nHe looked now into the pale face of his wife ... and she was smiling.\n\n“There, there,” said the great surgeon. “I told you she would come back. Her constitution——”\n\n“Constitution!” scoffed the nurse. “It was you.”\n\n“Or,” smiled the surgeon, magnanimously, “your prayers, sir.”\n\nBut the sick woman made a gesture of dissent.\n\n“No,” she said, “it was none of those things. I came back when I remembered——”\n\n“Paul,” she whispered, “lean down.”\n\nHe obeyed. Her palms fluttered against his cheeks, and, as lightly as a butterfly on a flower, her lips brushed his one closed eye\nand then the other. And then the girl who had been Ellen McCartney laughed a low, thrilling laugh, which spoke of youth in love in\nthe springtime.\n\n\nGREATER LOVE HATH NO MAN\n\nBy Selwyn Grattan\n\nThe empty vial—the odour of bitter almonds—and in the chair what had been a man.\n\nOn the desk this note:\n\n> “Farewell. From the day of our marriage I have known. I love you. I love my friend. Better that I should go and leave you two to\n> find happiness than that I should stay and the three of us wear out wretched lives. Again farewell—and bless you.",

He propounded this interesting query:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&ldquo;How short can a short story be and still be a short story?&rdquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>It was thereupon determined to discover, if possible, a practical answer to this interesting question. The columns of&nbsp;<em>Life</em>&nbsp;were thrown open to contributors for many months, prizes aggregating $1,750 were offered and eighty-one short stories were published. This book contains these stories, including the four prize winners.</p>\r\n<p>The contest cost in round numbers a little less than $12,000. Over thirty thousand manuscripts were received. They came from all over the world&mdash;from sufferers on hospital cots, from literary toilers in the Philippines, from Europe, Asia, and Africa, and from every State in the Union. One manuscript was sent from a trench at the French battle front, where the story had been written between hand grenades. Every kind of story was represented, the war story and the love story being the leaders. Every kind of writing was represented, from the short compound of trite banalities to the terse, dramatic, carefully wrought out climax. Back of many of these efforts the spectral forms of Guy de Maupassant and O. Henry hovered in sardonic triumph. Tragedy predominated. The light touch was few and far between. But it was still there, as the stories published show.</p>\r\n<p>Here let me pay a just tribute to the readers who, with almost superhuman courage, struggled through these thirty thousand manuscripts. In the beginning they were a noble band of highly intelligent and cultivated men and women, with strong constitutions, ready and willing to face literature in any form. I understand that many of them survived the contest. This speaks well for the virility of our American stock. Theirs was a noble and enduring toil, and theirs will be a noble and enduring fame. Without them this book now might contain twenty-nine thousand nine hundred and eleven poor stories instead of eighty-one good ones. To those among them who still live, a long life and, let us hope, an ultimate recovery!</p>\r\n<p>Naturally, in the method of securing the stories, there had to be some way of getting the contributors to make them as short as possible. Mr. Steffens&rsquo; ingenious suggestion admirably attained this end. First, a limit of fifteen hundred words was placed upon all stories submitted, no story longer than this being admitted to the contest. For each story accepted the contributor was paid, not for what he wrote, but for what he did not write. That is to say, he was paid at the rate of ten cents a word for the difference between what he wrote and fifteen hundred words. If his story, for example, happened to be 1,500 words in length, he got nothing. If it was 1,490 words he got one dollar. If there had been a story only ten words long, the author would have received $149. To be accurate, the longest story actually accepted for the contest was 1,495 words, for which the author received fifty cents, and the shortest was 76 words, for which the author received $142.40. The interested reader will be able to discover the identity of these two stories by examining the stories in the book. At the original luncheon party a large part of the warm discussion that took place turned on how short a story could be made and still come within the definition of a short story. It was really a question as to when is a story not a story, but only an anecdote. When a story is a story, is it a combination of plot, character, and setting or is it determined by only one of these three elements? Must it end when you have ended it or must it suggest something beyond the reading? I shall not attempt to answer these questions. The definition of the short story should be relegated to the realm of &ldquo;What is Humor?&rdquo; &ldquo;Who is the mother of the chickens?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How Old is Ann?&rdquo; If you really wish to vary the monotony of your intellectual life and get it away from &ldquo;Who Wrote Shakespeare?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Who killed Jack Robinson?&rdquo; start a discussion as to what a short story is. It has long been my private opinion that the best short story in the world is the story of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, but I have no doubt that, should I venture this assertion in the company of others, there would be one to ask: &ldquo;What has that to do with the price of oil now?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>But in order that the reader may have some idea of the method adopted in judging the stories which were finally selected, it may be well to give what I may term a composite definition of what a short story is, gathered from the various opinions offered when the contest was originally under discussion by the judges. This definition is not intended to be complete or final. It is not the cohesive opinion of one individual, but only a number of rather off-hand opinions which are of undoubted psychological interest as bearing upon the final decisions.</p>\r\n<p>A short story must contain at least two characters, for otherwise there would be no contrast or struggle. A situation must be depicted in which there are two opposing forces.</p>\r\n<p>A short story must be a picture out of real life which gives the reader a definite sensation, such as he gets upon looking at a masterpiece of painting. While it must be complete in itself, the art of it lies in what it suggests to the reader beyond its own limits. That is to say, it must convey an idea much larger than itself. This is the open sesame to the golden principle. (This is well illustrated in the story that took the first prize.)</p>\r\n<p>Every short story must of necessity deal with human beings, either directly or indirectly. It must reveal in the briefest manner possible&mdash;as it were, like a lightning flash&mdash;a situation that carries the reader beyond it. It is, therefore, inevitable that the supreme test of the short story lies in its climax. The climax must gather up everything that has gone before, and perhaps by only one word epitomize the whole situation in such a way as to produce in the reader a sense of revelation&mdash;just as if he were the sole spectator of a supremely interesting human mystery now suddenly made plain.</p>\r\n<p>The technique of the short story should be such that no word in its vocabulary will suggest triteness or the fatal thought that the author is dependent upon others for his phrasing. When, for example, we read &ldquo;With a glad cry she threw her arms about him&rdquo; &ldquo;A hoarse shout went up from the vast throng&rdquo; &ldquo;He flicked the ashes,&rdquo; we know at once that the author is only dealing in echoes.</p>\r\n<p>These were some of the general considerations which governed the readers and judges, but it would be unfair to say that there were not other considerations which came up later on. In a number of instances, manuscripts which were interesting and well written, and even longer than others that were accepted for the contest, were rejected because it was felt that they were not really stories, but more in the nature of descriptive sketches.</p>\r\n<p>So far as the practical method pursued was concerned, it will not be amiss to state briefly how the work was carried on.</p>\r\n<p>It was deemed best, on general principles, to let the authors of the stories have a hand in the matter, the editors feeling frankly that they preferred a disinterested method which would relieve them in a measure from the fullest responsibility. The conditions were therefore made to read that:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The editors of &lsquo;Life&rsquo; will first select out of all the stories published, the twelve which are, in their judgment, the best. The authors of these twelve stories will then be asked to become judges of the whole contest, which will then include all the stories published. These twelve authors will decide which are the best three stories, in the order of their merit, to be awarded the prizes. In case for any reason any one or more of these twelve authors should be unable to act as a judge, then the contest will be decided by the rest.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Each of these twelve judges will, of course, if he so wishes, vote for his own story first, so that the final result may probably be determined by the combined second, third, and fourth choices of all the judges. This, however, will not affect the result. In case of a division among the judges, the Editors of &lsquo;Life&rsquo; will cast the deciding vote.&rdquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>This method worked well and was fully justified by the final result. As the manuscripts were received they were registered according to a careful clerical system and turned over to the readers, who were from five to seven in number, including three women. The rule was that each story should be read independently by at least two readers, their verdicts separately recorded. If they were unanimous in rejecting a story, it was returned. If they were agreed upon its merits, or if they were at all doubtful, it was then passed up to the five members of&nbsp;<em>Life&rsquo;s</em>&nbsp;editorial staff. It was read and reread by them, and the individual comments of each editor recorded independently. By this sifting process, each story was subjected to a final process of discussion and elimination. The stories, as accepted, were paid for on the basis of ten cents a word for all the words under 1,500 which the story did not contain and were published in&nbsp;<em>Life</em>. From the authors of the eighty-one stories published, the editors selected the following twelve judges, each one of whom consented to serve:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Herbert Heron, Carmel, Cal.</li>\r\n<li>J. H. Ranxom, Houston, Texas.</li>\r\n<li>Ralph Henry Barbour, Manchester, Mass.</li>\r\n<li>Clarence Herbert New, Brooklyn, N. Y.</li>\r\n<li>William Johnston, New York City.</li>\r\n<li>Graham Clark, New York City.</li>\r\n<li>Mrs. Elsie D. Knisely, Everett, Wash.</li>\r\n<li>Mrs. Jane Dahl, San Francisco, Cal.</li>\r\n<li>Selwyn Grattan, New York City.</li>\r\n<li>E. L. Smith, Ft. Worth, Texas.</li>\r\n<li>Herbert Riley Howe, Sioux Falls, S. Dak.</li>\r\n<li>Miss Ruth Sterry, Los Angeles, Cal.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>These judges, independently of each other, sent in their opinions, several of them not voting for their own stories as the first prize, although this was allowable under the rules. There was no difficulty on their part in awarding the first prize of one thousand dollars and the second prize of five hundred dollars. In the case of the third prize there was such a division of opinion that the editors, under the rule of the competition that gave them the final decision, determined that it would be fair to divide the third prize between two competitors who had received the same number of the judges&rsquo; votes.</p>\r\n<p>The prize winners were as follows:</p>\r\n<dl>\r\n<dt>FIRST PRIZE</dt>\r\n<dd>Ralph Henry Barbour of Manchester, Mass., and George Randolph Osborne of Cambridge, Mass., joint authors of &ldquo;Thicker Than Water.&rdquo;</dd>\r\n<dt>SECOND PRIZE</dt>\r\n<dd>Harry Stillwell Edwards of Macon, Georgia, author of &ldquo;The Answer.&rdquo;</dd>\r\n<dt>THIRD PRIZE</dt>\r\n<dd>Dwight M. Wiley of Princeton, Ill., author of &ldquo;Her Memory,&rdquo; and Redfield Ingalls of New York City, author of &ldquo;Business and Ethics.&rdquo; This prize was divided.</dd>\r\n</dl>\r\n<p>This book is now offered to the public in the confident hope and the firm belief that it will be found a valuable contribution to the literature of short fiction, in addition to the interest it also merits because of the stories themselves.</p>\r\n<p>One final point should be emphasized. This book is not, in the very nature of the case, a book of uniform literary style; it is not the polished expression of the highest literary art. It is the best of thirty thousand attempts to write a short story, by all sorts and conditions of minds&mdash;a fair proportion of them amateurs, a fair proportion writers of considerable experience, and a small proportion excellently skilled craftsmen. In their final selection of these stories, the readers and judges were governed, not so much by the question &ldquo;Is this superfine literary art?&rdquo; as they were by the question &ldquo;Is this interesting?&rdquo; By this touchstone the book certainly justifies its existence.</p>\r\n<div>T.

B.</h2>\r\n<div>By Joseph Hall</div>\r\n<p>Lieutenant Ludwig Kreusler glanced hurriedly through the mail that had accumulated during the month that the X-8 had been away from base. At the bottom of the pile he found the letter he had been seeking and his eyes brightened. It was a fat letter, addressed in feminine handwriting, and its original postmark was Washington, D. C., U. S. A.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;His Excellency will see you, sir.&rdquo; The orderly had entered quietly and stood at attention.</p>\r\n<p>With a slightly impatient shrug the Lieutenant shoved the letters into his pocket and left the room.</p>\r\n<p>He found Admiral Von Herpitz, the wizard of the sea, at his desk. As the young man entered the old Admiral rose and came forward. This unusual mark of favour somewhat embarrassed the young officer until the old man, placing both huge hands upon his shoulders, looked into his eyes.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Excellent.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The one word conveyed a volume of praise, gratification. The old sea dog was known as a silent man. Censure was more frequent from him than applause.</p>\r\n<p>The Lieutenant could find no word. The situation was for him embarrassing in the extreme. He, like Herpitz, was a man of actions, and words confused him.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;These English,&rdquo; the old Admiral spoke grimly, &ldquo;we will teach them. Have you seen the reports? They are having quite a little panic in America also over the&nbsp;<em>Seronica</em>. Two hundred of the passengers lost were American.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>A file of papers lay on the table. Kreusler ran through them hurriedly. The Berlin journals gave the sinking of the&nbsp;<em>Seronica</em>&nbsp;great headlines followed by columns of sheer joy. The London and Paris and some of the New York sheets called the exploit a crime and its perpetrators pirates. But they all gave it utter and undivided thought. The X-8 had become the horror craft of the world. Berlin figuratively carried her young commander on her shoulders. He found himself the hero of the hour.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You have done well for the Fatherland,&rdquo; Von Herpitz repeated as the Lieutenant was going out.</p>\r\n<p>In his own cabin Kreusler forgot the&nbsp;<em>Seronica</em>&nbsp;and the X-8. The fat letter with the Washington postmark absorbed him.</p>\r\n<p>Two years, ending with the outbreak of the great war, Kreusler had been naval attach&eacute; to the German embassy at Washington. He had been popular in the society of the American capital. He was highly educated, a profound scientist, an original thinker, and an adaptable and interesting dinner guest. Dorothy Washburn, the youngest daughter of the Senator from Oregon, had made her d&eacute;but in Washington during the second winter of Kreusler&rsquo;s presence there. The two had met. They were exact opposites; he tall, severe, blond, thoughtfully serious; she, small, dark, vivacious, bubbling with the joy of life. Love was inevitable.</p>\r\n<p>The fat letter was engrossing. It breathed in every line and word and syllable the fine love this wonder woman gave him. One paragraph was most astounding. It read:</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;To be near thee, loved one, I have arranged, through the gracious kindness of our friends, to come to Berlin as a nurse. Just when is as yet uncertain, but come I will, fear not, as quickly as may be. Dost long for me, to see me, dearest heart, as I for thee? Well, soon perhaps that may not be so far away. Couldst not thou arrange to be wounded&mdash;only slightly, of course, my love&mdash;so that I might attend thee?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The letter ended with tender love messages and assurances of devotion. The last sheet bore a single word, &ldquo;Over,&rdquo; and on the reverse side a woman&rsquo;s most important news, a postscript. This read:</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;P. S. Arrangements have been completed. Everything is settled. Even my father has consented, knowing of my great love. I sail next week.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>And then:</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;N. B. The ship on which I sail is the&nbsp;<em>Seronica</em>.&rdquo;</p>\r\n</section>\r\n<section>\r\n<h2>THE CLEAREST CALL</h2>\r\n<div>By Brevard Mays Connor</div>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; said the great surgeon. &ldquo;She will pull through. She has a fine constitution.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;She will pull through because&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;are handling the case,&rdquo; the nurse murmured, with an admiring glance.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;She will pull through,&rdquo; agreed the Reverend Paul Templeton, &ldquo;because I shall pray.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>He did not see the ironical glance which passed between nurse and doctor, materialists both. He had stooped and kissed his wife, who lay on the wheeled table that was to carry her to the operating room. She was asleep, for the narcotic had taken immediate effect.</p>\r\n<p>For a moment he hung over her and then he moved aside. When the door of the operating room had closed on the wheeled table with its sheeted burden he stepped out on the little upper balcony beneath the stars, knelt, and earnestly addressed himself to his Maker.</p>\r\n<p>A distant clock struck eight. The operation would take an hour....</p>\r\n<p>Humbly he prayed, but with superb confidence. He had lived a blameless life, and his efforts were in behalf of a life equally blameless. It was inconceivable that he who had given all and asked nothing should be refused this, his first request. It was even more inconceivable that his wife, who was so worthy of pardon, should be condemned. Humbly he prayed, but not without assurance of a friendly Auditor.</p>\r\n<p>It was a sweet May night, satin-soft, blossom-scented. The south wind was whispering confidences to the elms; the stars were unutterably benign. Surely God was in His heaven, thought the Reverend Paul Templeton.</p>\r\n<p>Then up from the darkness beneath the trees came the low, thrilling laugh of a girl. He lifted his face from his hands and stared, scarce breathing, into the night, while his ears still held every note of that low, thrilling laugh, which spoke of youth in love in the springtime.</p>\r\n<p>The black bulk of the hospital behind him faded into obscurity as swiftly as a scene struck on a darkened stage. He was no longer on a little upper porch, but in an old-fashioned summer-house, hidden from the tactless moon by a mesh of honeysuckle in bloom. He was no longer on his knees before his Maker, but sitting beside the girl who had been Ellen McCartney.</p>\r\n<p>She was dressed in white. She was so close he could feel the warmth of her. Somehow, in that darkness, their hands met and clung, shoulder touched shoulder&mdash;the fragrance of her hair in his nostrils. The soft, womanly yielding of her body.</p>\r\n<p>Now her palms were resting against his cheeks, drawing his head down; now, as lightly as a butterfly upon a flower, her lips brushed his one closed eye and then the other; now she laughed, a low, thrilling laugh, which spoke of youth in love in the springtime.</p>\r\n<p>Prayer had gone dry at its source, choked by the luxuriant vegetation of memory. He remembered other kisses and thrilled in sympathy with the delight of other time....</p>\r\n<p>The distant clock struck nine, but he did not hear it. The shriek of a woman in pain sliced through the silence but could not penetrate the walls of his dream. The girl who had been Ellen McCartney lay in his arms, her lips to his.</p>\r\n<p>Then a hand fell upon his shoulder.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said the nurse, and slipped back into the room.</p>\r\n<p>The Reverend Paul Templeton came back with a wrench to consciousness of the time and place, and horror surged through his veins like a burning poison. It was over&mdash;and he had not prayed! And worse! When his whole being should have been prostrate in humble supplication he had allowed it to walk brazenly erect among memories that at the best were frivolous and at the worst&mdash;carnal! He seemed to hear a voice saying:</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I am the Lord of Vengeance. Heavy is mine hand against them that slight Me!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Mastered by despair, he clung to the iron railing. What could he hope of science when he had failed in his duty to faith? Somehow he managed to struggle to his feet and gain the room.</p>\r\n<p>The sheeted figure on the bed was very still, the face paler than the pillow on which it lay. He crumpled down beside her and hid his face, too sick with shame to weep. He&nbsp;<em>knew</em>&nbsp;with a horrid certainty that she was dead and that he had killed her.</p>\r\n<p>And then:</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Paul!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>It was the merest wisp of sound, almost too impalpable to be human utterance. He lifted his head and looked into the face of the great surgeon.... He was smiling.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Paul!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>He looked now into the pale face of his wife ... and&nbsp;<em>she</em>&nbsp;was smiling.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;There, there,&rdquo; said the great surgeon. &ldquo;I told you she would come back. Her constitution&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Constitution!&rdquo; scoffed the nurse. &ldquo;It was you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Or,&rdquo; smiled the surgeon, magnanimously, &ldquo;your prayers, sir.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>But the sick woman made a gesture of dissent.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it was none of those things. I came back when I remembered&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Paul,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;lean down.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>He obeyed. Her palms fluttered against his cheeks, and, as lightly as a butterfly on a flower, her lips brushed his one closed eye and then the other. And then the girl who had been Ellen McCartney laughed a low, thrilling laugh, which spoke of youth in love in the springtime.</p>\r\n</section>\r\n<section>\r\n<h2>GREATER LOVE HATH NO MAN</h2>\r\n<div>By Selwyn Grattan</div>\r\n<p>The empty vial&mdash;the odour of bitter almonds&mdash;and in the chair what had been a man.</p>\r\n<p>On the desk this note:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Farewell.

If the verdict of the\nvillagers could have been taken, we should, perhaps, have been voted a queer set, familiar as dwellers in Franconia are with the\nsight of idle tourists,—\n\n\"Rapid and gay, as if the earth were air,And they were butterflies to wheel aboutLong as the summer lasted.\"\n\nWe were neither \"rapid\" nor \"gay,\" and it was still only the first week of June; if we were summer boarders, therefore, we must be\nof some unusual early-blooming variety.\n\n[Pg 2]\n\nFirst came a lady, in excellent repute among the savants of Europe and America as an entomologist, but better known to the general\npublic as a writer of stories. With her, as companion and assistant, was a doctor of laws, who is also a newspaper proprietor, a\nvoluminous author, an art connoisseur, and many things beside. They had turned their backs thus unseasonably upon the metropolis,\nand in this pleasant out-of-the-way corner were devoting themselves to one absorbing pursuit,—the pursuit of moths. On their daily\ndrives, two or three insect nets dangled conspicuously from the carriage,—the footman, thrifty soul, was never backward to take a\nhand,—and evening after evening the hotel piazza was illuminated till midnight with lamps and lanterns, while these enthusiasts\nwaved the same white nets about, gathering in geometries, noctuids, sphinges, and Heaven knows what else, all of them to perish\npainlessly in numerous \"cyanide bottles,\" which bestrewed the piazza by night, and (happy thought!) the closed piano by day. In\nthis noble occupation I sometimes played at helping; but with only meagre success, my most [Pg 3]brilliant catch being nothing\nmore important than a \"beautiful Io.\" The kind-hearted lepidopterist lingered with gracious emphasis upon the adjective, and\nassured me that the specimen would be all the more valuable because of a finger-mark which my awkwardness had left upon one of its\nwings. So—to the credit of human nature be it spoken—so does amiability sometimes get the better of the feminine scientific\nspirit. To the credit of human nature, I say; for, though her practice of the romancer's art may doubtless have given to this good\nlady some peculiar flexibility of mind, some special, individual facility in subordinating a lower truth to a higher, it surely\nmay be affirmed, also, of humanity in general, that few things become it better than its inconsistencies.\n\nOf the four remaining members of the company, two were botanists, and two—for the time—ornithologists. But the botanists were\nlovers of birds, also, and went nowhere without opera-glasses; while the ornithologists, in turn, did not hold themselves above\nsome elementary [Pg 4]knowledge of plants, and amused themselves with now and then pointing out some rarity—sedges and willows\nwere the special desiderata—which the professional collectors seemed in danger of passing without notice. All in all, we were a\nqueer set. How the Latin and Greek polysyllables flew about the dining-room, as we recounted our forenoon's or afternoon's\ndiscoveries! Somebody remarked once that the waiters' heads appeared to be more or less in danger; but if the waiters trembled at\nall, it was probably not for their own heads, but for ours. [1]\n[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/27285/27285-h/27285-h.htm#Footnote_1_1]\n\nOur first excursion—I speak of the four who traveled on foot—was to the Franconia Notch. It could not well have been otherwise; at\nall events, there was one of the four [Pg 5]whose feet would not willingly have carried him in any other direction. The mountains\ndrew us, and there was no thought of resisting their attraction.\n\nLove and curiosity are different, if not incompatible, sentiments; and the birds that are dearest to the man are, for that very\nreason, not most interesting to the ornithologist. When on a journey, I am almost without eyes or ears for bluebirds and robins,\nsong sparrows and chickadees. Now is my opportunity for extending my acquaintance, and such every-day favorites must get along for\nthe time as best they can without my attention. So it was here in Franconia. The vesper sparrow, the veery, and a host of other\nfriends were singing about the hotel and along the roadside, but we heeded them not. Our case was like the boy's who declined\ngingerbread, when on a visit: he had plenty of that at home.\n\nWhen we were nearly at the edge of the mountain woods, however, we heard across the field a few notes that brought all four of us\nto an instant standstill. What warbler could that be? Nobody could tell. In fact, nobody could guess. But, before [Pg 6]the\nyoungest of us could surmount the wall, the singer took wing, flew over our heads far into the woods, and all was silent. It was\ntoo bad; but there would be another day to-morrow. Meantime, we kept on up the hill, and soon were in the old forest, listening\nto bay-breasted warblers, Blackburnians, black-polls, and so on, while the noise of the mountain brook on our right, a better\nsinger than any of them, was never out of our ears. \"You are going up,\" it said. \"I wish you joy. But you see how it is; you will\nsoon have to come down again.\"\n\nI took leave of my companions at Profile Lake, they having planned an all-day excursion beyond, and started homeward by myself.\nSlowly, and with many stops, I sauntered down the long hill, through the forest (the stops, I need not say, are commonly the major\npart of a naturalist's ramble,—the golden beads, as it were, the walk itself being only the string), till I reached the spot where\nwe had been serenaded in the morning by our mysterious stranger. Yes, he was again singing, this time not far from the road, in a\nmoderately thick growth of small trees, under which the ground was [Pg 7]carpeted with club-mosses, dog-tooth violets, clintonia,\nlinnæa, and similar plants. He continued to sing, and I continued to edge my way nearer and nearer, till finally I was near\nenough, and went down on my knees. Then I saw him, facing me, showing white under parts. A Tennessee warbler! Here was good luck\nindeed. I ogled him for a long time (\"Shoot it,\" says Mr. Burroughs, authoritatively, \"not ogle it with a glass;\" but a man must\nfollow his own method), impatient to see his back, and especially the top of his head. What a precious frenzy we fall into at such\nmoments! My knees were fairly upon nettles. He flew, and I followed. Once more he was under the glass, but still facing me. How\nlike a vireo he looked! For one instant I thought, Can it be the Philadelphia vireo? But, though I had never seen that bird, I\nknew its song to be as different as possible from the notes to which I was listening. After a long time the fellow turned to\nfeeding, and now I obtained a look at his upper parts,—the back olive, the head ashy, like the Nashville warbler. That was enough.\nIt was indeed the Tennessee (Helminthophila peregrina), [Pg 8]a bird for which I had been ten years on the watch.\n\nThe song, which has not often been described, is more suggestive of the Nashville's than of any other, but so decidedly different\nas never for a moment to be confounded with it. \"When you hear it,\" a friend had said to me several years before, \"you will know\nit for something new.\" It is long (I speak comparatively, of course), very sprightly, and peculiarly staccato, and is made up of\ntwo parts, the second quicker in movement and higher in pitch than the first. I speak of it as in two parts, though when my\ncompanions came to hear it, as they did the next day, they reported it as in three. We visited the place together afterwards, and\nthe discrepancy was readily explained. As to pitch, the song is in three parts, but as to rhythm and character, it is in two; the\nfirst half being composed of double notes, the second of single notes. The resemblance to the Nashville's song lies entirely in\nthe first part; the notes of the concluding portion are not run together or jumbled, after the Nashville's manner, but are quite\nas distinct as those of the opening measure.\n\n[Pg 9]\n\nAs there were at least two pairs of the birds, and they were unmistakably at home, we naturally had hope of finding one of the\nnests. We made several random attempts, and one day I devoted an hour or more to a really methodical search; but the wily singer\ngave me not the slightest clue, behaving as if there were no such thing as a bird's nest within a thousand miles, and all my\nendeavors went for nothing.\n\nAs might have been foreseen, Franconia proved to be an excellent place in which to study the difficult family of flycatchers. All\nour common eastern Massachusetts species were present,—the kingbird, the phœbe, the wood pewee, and the least flycatcher,—and with\nthem the crested flycatcher (not common), the olive-sided, the traill, and the yellow-bellied. The phœbe-like cry of the traill\nwas to be heard constantly from the hotel piazza. The yellow-bellied seemed to be confined to deep and rather swampy woods in the\nvalley, and to the mountain-side forests; being most numerous on Mount Lafayette, where it ran well up toward the limit of trees.\nIn his notes, the yellow-belly may be said to take [Pg 10]after both the least flycatcher and the wood pewee. His killic (so\nwritten in the books, and I do not know how to improve upon it) resembles the chebec of the least flycatcher, though much less\nemphatic, as well as much less frequently uttered, while his twee, or tuwee, is quite in the voice and manner of the wood pewee's\nclear, plaintive whistle; usually a monosyllable, but at other times almost or quite dissyllabic. The olive-sided, on the other\nhand, imitates nobody; or, if he does, it must be some bird with which I have yet to make acquaintance. Que-qúe-o he vociferates,\nwith a strong emphasis and drawl upon the middle syllable. This is his song, or what answers to a song, but I have seen him when\nhe would do nothing but repeat incessantly a quick trisyllabic call, whit, whit, whit; corresponding, I suppose, to the\nwell-known whit with which the phœbe sometimes busies himself in a similar manner.\n\nOf more interest than any flycatcher—of more interest even than the Tennessee warbler—was a bird found by the roadside in the\nvillage, after we had been for several days in the place. Three of us were [Pg 11]walking together, talking by the way, when all\nat once we halted, as by a common impulse, at the sound of a vireo song; a red-eye's song, as it seemed, with the faintest touch\nof something unfamiliar about it. The singer was in a small butternut-tree close upon the sidewalk, and at once afforded us\nperfectly satisfactory observations, perching on a low limb within fifteen feet of our eyes, and singing again and again, while we\nscrutinized every feather through our glasses. As one of my companions said, it was like having the bird in your hand. There was\nno room for a question as to its identity. At last we had before us the rare and long-desired Philadelphia greenlet. As its song\nis little known, I here transcribe my notes about it, made at two different times, between which there appears to have been some\ndiscussion among us as to just how it should be characterized:—\n\n\"The song is very pretty, and is curiously compounded of the red-eye's and the solitary's, both as to phrase and quality. The\nmeasures are all brief; with fewer syllables, that is to say, than the red-eye commonly uses. Some of them are exactly like the[Pg\n12] red-eye's, while others have the peculiar sweet upward inflection of the solitary's. To hear some of the measures, you would\npass the bird for a red-eye; to hear others of them, you might pass him for a solitary. At the same time, he has not the most\nhighly characteristic of the solitary's phrases. His voice is less sharp and his accent less emphatic than the red-eye's, and, so\nfar as we heard, he observes decidedly longer rests between the measures.\"\n\nThis is under date of June 16th. On the following day I made another entry:—\n\n\"The song is, I think, less varied than either the solitary's or the red-eye's, but it grows more distinct from both as it is\nlonger heard. Acquaintance will probably make it as characteristic and unmistakable as any of our four other vireo songs. But I do\nnot withdraw what I said yesterday about its resemblance to the red-eye's and the solitary's. The bird seems quite fearless, and\nkeeps much of the time in the lower branches. In this latter respect his habit is in contrast with that of the warbling vireo.\"\n\nOn the whole, then, the song of the Philadelphia vireo comes nearest to the red-eye's,[Pg 13] differing from it mainly in tone and\ninflection rather than in form. In these two respects it suggests the solitary vireo, though it never reproduces the indescribably\nsweet cadence, the real \"dying fall,\" of that most delightful songster. At the risk of a seeming contradiction, however, I must\nmention one curious circumstance. On going again to Franconia, a year afterwards, and, naturally, keeping my ears open for Vireo\nphiladelphicus, I discovered that I was never for a moment in doubt when I heard a red-eye; but once, on listening to a distant\nsolitary,—catching only part of the strain,—I was for a little quite uncertain whether he might not be the bird for which I was\nlooking. How this fact is to be explained I am unable to say; it will be least surprising to those who know most of such matters,\nand at all events I think it worth recording as affording a possible clue to some future observer. The experience, inconsistent as\nthe assertion may sound, does not in the least alter my opinion that the Philadelphia's song is practically certain to be confused\nwith the red-eye's rather than with the solitary's. Upon that point my companions [Pg 14]and I were perfectly agreed while we had\nthe bird before us, and Mr. Brewster's testimony is abundantly conclusive to the same effect. He was in the Umbagog forests on a\nspecial hunt for Philadelphia vireos (he had collected specimens there on two previous occasions), and after some days of\nfruitless search discovered, almost by accident, that the birds had all the while been singing close about him, but in every\ninstance had passed for \"nothing but red-eyes.\" [2] [https://www.gutenberg.org/files/27285/27285-h/27285-h.htm#Footnote_2_2]\n\nFor the benefit of the lay reader, I ought, perhaps, to have explained before this that the Philadelphia vireo is in coloration an\nexact copy of the warbling vireo. There is a slight difference in size between the two, but the most practiced eye could not be\ndepended upon to tell them apart in a tree. Vireo philadelphicus is in a peculiar case: it looks like one common bird, and sings\nlike another. It might have been invented on purpose to circumvent collectors, as the Almighty has been supposed by some to have\ncreated fossils on purpose to deceive ungodly geologists. It is not surprising, therefore, that the bird escaped the notice [Pg\n15]of the older ornithologists. In fact, it was first described,—by Mr. Cassin,—in 1851, from a specimen taken, nine years before,\nnear Philadelphia; and its nest remained unknown for more than thirty years longer, the first one having been discovered,\napparently in Canada, in 1884. [3] [https://www.gutenberg.org/files/27285/27285-h/27285-h.htm#Footnote_3_3]\n\nDay after day, the bare, sharp crest of Mount Lafayette silently invited my feet. Then came a bright, favorable morning, and I set\nout. I would go alone on this my first pilgrimage to the noble peak, at which, always from too far off, I had gazed longingly for\nten summers. It is not inconsistent with a proper regard for one's fellows, I trust, to enjoy now and then being without their\nsociety. It is good, sometimes, for a man to be alone,—especially on a mountain-top, and more especially at a first visit. The\ntrip to the summit was some seven or eight miles in length, and an almost continual ascent, without a dull step in the whole\ndistance. The Tennessee warbler was singing; but perhaps the pleasantest incident of the walk to the Profile House—in front of\nwhich the mountain footpath is taken—was [Pg 16]a Blackburnian warbler perched, as usual, at the very top of a tall spruce, his\norange throat flashing fire as he faced the sun, and his song, as my notebook expresses it, \"sliding up to high Z at the end\" in\nhis quaintest and most characteristic fashion. I spent nearly three hours in climbing the mountain path, and during all that time\nsaw and heard only twelve kinds of birds: redstarts, Canada warblers (near the base), black-throated blues, black-throated\ngreens, Nashvilles, black-polls, red-eyed vireos, snowbirds (no white-throated sparrows!), winter wrens, Swainson and gray-cheeked\nthrushes, and yellow-bellied flycatchers. Black-poll and Nashville warblers were especially numerous, as they are also upon Mount\nWashington, and, as far as I have seen, upon the White Mountains generally. The feeble, sharp song of the black-poll is a singular\naffair; short and slight as it is, it embraces a perfect crescendo and a perfect decrescendo. Without question I passed plenty of\nwhite-throated sparrows, but by some coincidence not one of them announced himself. The gray-cheeked thrushes, which sang freely,\nwere not heard till I was [Pg 17]perhaps halfway between the Eagle Cliff Notch and the Eagle Lakes. This species, so recently\nadded to our summer fauna, proves to be not uncommon in the mountainous parts of New England, though apparently confined to the\nspruce forests at or near the summits. I found it abundant on Mount Mansfield, Vermont, in 1885, and in the summer of 1888 Mr.\nWalter Faxon surprised us all by shooting a specimen on Mount Graylock, Massachusetts. Doubtless the bird has been singing its\nperfectly distinctive song in the White Mountain woods ever since the white man first visited them. During the vernal migration,\nindeed, I have more than once heard it sing in eastern Massachusetts. My latest delightful experience of this kind was on the 29th\nof May last (1889), while I was hastening to a railway train within the limits of Boston. Preoccupied as I was, and faintly as the\nnotes came to me, I recognized them instantly; for while the gray-cheek's song bears an evident resemblance to the veery's (which\nI had heard within five minutes), the two are so unlike in pitch and rhythm that no reasonably nice ear ought ever to [Pg\n18]confound them. The bird was just over the high, close, inhospitable fence, on the top of which I rested my chin and watched and\nlistened. He sat with his back toward me, in full view, on a level with my eye, and sang and sang and sang, in a most deliciously\nsoft, far-away voice, keeping his wings all the while a little raised and quivering, as in a kind of musical ecstasy. It does seem\na thing to be regretted—yes, a thing to be ashamed of—that a bird so beautiful, so musical, so romantic in its choice of a\ndwelling-place, and withal so characteristic of New England should be known, at a liberal estimate, to not more than one or two\nhundred New Englanders! But if a bird wishes general recognition, he should do as the robin does, and the bluebird, and the\noriole,—dress like none of his neighbors, and show himself freely in the vicinity of men's houses. How can one expect to be famous\nunless he takes a little pains to keep himself before the public?\n\nFrom the time I left my hotel until I was fairly above the dwarf spruces below the summit of Lafayette, I was never for many\nminutes together out of the hearing of thrush [Pg 19]music. Four of our five summer representatives of the genus Turdus took\nturns, as it were, in the serenade. The veeries—Wilson's thrushes—greeted me before I stepped off the piazza. As I neared the\nProfile House farm, the hermits were in tune on either hand. The moment the road entered the ancient forest, the olive-backs began\nto make themselves heard, and halfway up the mountain path the gray-cheeks took up the strain and carried it on to its heavenly\nconclusion. A noble processional! Even a lame man might have climbed to such music. If the wood thrush had been here, the chorus\nwould have been complete,—a chorus not to be excelled, according to my untraveled belief, in any quarter of the world.\n\nTo-day, however, my first thoughts were not of birds, but of the mountain. The weather was all that could be asked,—the\ntemperature perfect, and the atmosphere so transparent as to be of itself a kind of lens; so that in the evening, when I rejoined\nmy companions at the hotel, I found to my astonishment that I had been plainly visible while at the summit, the beholders\nhaving [Pg 20]no other help than an opera-glass! It was almost past belief. I had felt some dilation of soul, it was true, but had\nbeen quite unconscious of any corresponding physical transformation. What would our aboriginal forerunners have said could they\nhave stood in the valley and seen a human form moving from point to point along yonder sharp, serrated ridge? I should certainly\nhave passed for a god! Let us be thankful that all such superstitious fancies have had their day. The Indian, poor child of\nnature,\n\n\"A pagan suckled in a creed outworn,\"\n\nstood afar off and worshiped toward these holy hills; but the white man clambers gayly up their sides, guide-book in hand, and\nleaves his sardine box and eggshells—and likely enough his business card—at the top. Let us be thankful, I repeat, for the light\nvouchsafed to us; ours is a goodly heritage; but there are moods—such creatures of hereditary influence are we—wherein I would\ngladly exchange both the guide-book and the sardine box for a vision, never so indistinct and transient, of Kitche Manitoo. Alas!\nwhat a long time it is since any of us [Pg 21]have been able to see the invisible. \"In the mountains,\" says Wordsworth, \"did he\nfeel his faith.\" But the poet was speaking then of a very old-fashioned young fellow, who, even when he grew up, made nothing but\na peddler. Had he lived in our day, he would have felt not his faith, but his own importance; especially if he had put himself out\nof breath, as most likely he would have done, in accomplishing in an hour and forty minutes what, according to the guide-book,\nshould have taken a full hour and three quarters. The modern excursionist (how Wordsworth would have loved that word!) has learned\nwisdom of a certain wise fowl who once taught St. Peter a lesson, and who never finds himself in a high place without an impulse\nto flap his wings and crow.\n\nFor my own part, though I spent nearly three hours on the less than four miles of mountain path, as I have already acknowledged, I\nwas nevertheless somewhat short-winded at the end. So long as I was in the woods, it was easy enough to loiter; but no sooner did\nI leave the last low spruces behind me than I was seized with an importunate desire to stand upon the peak, so near [Pg 22]at hand\njust above me. I hope my readers are none of them too old to sympathize with the boyish feeling. At all events, I quickened my\npace. The distance could not be more than half a mile, I thought. But it was wonderful how that perverse trail among the boulders\ndid unwind itself, as if it never would come to an end; and I was not surprised, on consulting a guide-book afterwards, to find\nthat my half mile had really been a mile and a half. One's sensations in such a case I have sometimes compared with those of an\nessay-writer when he is getting near the end of his task. He dallied with it in the beginning, and was half ready to throw it up\nin the middle; but now the fever is on him, and he cannot drive the pen fast enough. Two days ago he doubted whether or not to\nburn the thing; now it is certain to be his masterpiece, and he must sit up till morning, if need be, to finish it. What would\nlife be worth without its occasional enthusiasm, laughable in the retrospect, perhaps, but in itself pleasurable almost to the\npoint of painfulness?\n\nIt was a glorious day. I enjoyed the climb, the lessening forest, the alpine [Pg 23]plants (the diapensia was in full flower, with\nits upright snowy goblets, while the geum and the Greenland sandwort were just beginning to blossom), the magnificent prospect,\nthe stimulating air, and, most of all, the mountain itself. I sympathized then, as I have often done at other times, with a remark\nonce made to me by a Vermont farmer's wife. I had sought a night's lodging at her house, and during the evening we fell into\nconversation about Mount Mansfield, from the top of which I had just come, and directly at the base of which the farmhouse stood.\nWhen she went up \"the mounting,\" she said, she liked to look off, of course; but somehow what she cared most about was \"the\nmounting itself.\"\n\nThe woman had probably never read a line of Wordsworth, unless possibly, \"We are Seven\" was in the old school reader; but I am\nsure the poet would have liked this saying, especially as coming from such a source. I liked it, at any rate, and am seldom on a\nmountain-top without recalling it. Her lot had been narrow and prosaic,—bitterly so, the visitor was likely to think; she was\nlittle used to expressing herself, and [Pg 24]no doubt would have wondered what Mr. Pater could mean by his talk about natural\nobjects as possessing \"more or less of a moral or spiritual life,\" as \"capable of a companionship with man, full of expression, of\ninexplicable affinities and delicacies of intercourse.\" From such refinements and subtleties her mind would have taken refuge in\nthoughts of her baking and ironing. But she enjoyed the mountain; I think she had some feeling for it, as for a friend; and who\nknows but she, too, was one of \"the poets that are sown by Nature\"?\n\nI spent two happy hours and a half at the summit of Lafayette. The ancient peak must have had many a worthier guest, but it could\nnever have entertained one more hospitably. With what softly temperate breezes did it fan me! I wish I were there now! But kind as\nwas its welcome, it did not urge me to remain. The word of the brook came true again,—as Nature's words always do, if we hear them\naright. Having gone as high as my feet could carry me, there was nothing left but to go down again. \"Which things,\" as Paul said\nto the Galatians, \"are an allegory.\"\n\n[Pg 25]\n\nI was not asked to stay, but I was invited to come again; and the next season, also in June, I twice accepted the invitation. On\nthe first of these occasions, although I was eight days later than I had been the year before (June 19th instead of June 11th),\nthe diapensia was just coming into somewhat free bloom, while the sandwort showed only here and there a stray flower, and\nthe geum was only in bud. The dwarf paper birch (trees of no one knows what age, matting the ground) was in blossom, with large,\nhandsome catkins, while Cutler's willow was already in fruit, and the crowberry likewise. The willow, like the birch, has learned\nthat the only way to live in such a place is to lie flat upon the ground and let the wind blow over you. The other flowers noted\nat the summit were one of the blueberries (Vaccinium uliginosum), Bigelow's sedge, and the fragrant alpine holy-grass (Hierochloa\nalpina). Why should this sacred grass, which Christians sprinkle in front of their church doors on feast-days, be scattered thus\nupon our higher mountain-tops, unless these places are indeed, as the Indian and the ancient Hebrew believed, the special abode of\nthe Great Spirit?\n\n[Pg 26]\n\nBut the principal interest of this my second ascent of Mount Lafayette was to be not botanical, but ornithological. We had seen\nnothing noteworthy on the way up (I was not alone this time, though I have so far been rude enough to ignore my companion); but\nwhile at the Eagle Lakes, on our return, we had an experience that threw me into a nine days' fever. The other man—one of the\nbotanists of last year's crew—was engaged in collecting viburnum specimens, when all at once I caught sight of something red in a\ndead spruce on the mountain-side just across the tiny lake. I leveled my glass, and saw with perfect distinctness, as I thought,\ntwo pine grosbeaks in bright male costume,—birds I had never seen before except in winter. Presently a third one, in dull plumage,\ncame into view, having been hidden till now behind the bole. The trio remained in sight for some time, and then dropped into the\nliving spruces underneath, and disappeared. I lingered about, while my companion and the black flies were busy, and was on the\npoint of turning away for good, when up flew two red birds and alighted in a tree close by the [Pg 27]one out of which the\ngrosbeaks had dropped. But a single glance showed that they were not grosbeaks, but white-winged crossbills! And soon they, too,\nwere joined by a third bird, in female garb. Here was a pretty piece of confusion! I was delighted to see the crossbills, having\nnever before had the first glimpse of them, summer or winter; but what was I to think about the grosbeaks? \"Your determination is\nworthless,\" said my scientific friend, consolingly; and there was no gainsaying his verdict. Yet by what possibility could I have\nbeen so deceived? The birds, though none too near, had given me an excellent observation, and as long as they were in sight I had\nfelt no uncertainty whatever as to their identity. The bill alone, of which I had taken particular note, ought in all reason to be\nheld conclusive. So much for one side of the case. On the other hand, however, the second trio were unmistakably crossbills. (They\nhad been joined on the wing by several others, as I ought to have mentioned, and with their characteristic chattering cry had\nswept out of sight up the mountain). It was certainly a curious coincidence: three [Pg 28]grosbeaks—two males and a female—had\ndropped out of a tree into the undergrowth; and then, five minutes later, three crossbills—two males and a female—had risen out of\nthe same undergrowth, and taken almost the very perch which the others had quitted! Had this strange thing happened? Or had my\neyes deceived me? This was my dilemma, on the sharp horns of which I tried alternately for the next eight days to make myself\ncomfortable.\n\nDuring all that time, the weather rendered mountain climbing impracticable. But the morning of the 28th was clear and cold, and I\nset out forthwith for the Eagle Lakes. If the grosbeaks were there, I meant to see them, though I should have to spend all day in\nthe attempt. My botanist had returned home, leaving me quite alone at the hotel; but, as good fortune would have it, before I\nreached the Profile House, I was overtaken unexpectedly by a young ornithological friend, who needed no urging to try the\nLafayette path. We were creeping laboriously up the long, steep shoulder beyond the Eagle Cliff gorge, and drawing near the lakes,\nwhen all at once a peculiarly sweet, flowing [Pg 29]warble fell upon our ears. \"A pine grosbeak!\" said I, in a tone of full\nassurance, although this was my first hearing of the song. The younger man plunged into the forest, in the direction of the voice,\nwhile I, knowing pretty well how the land lay, hastened on toward the lakes, in hopes to find the singer visible from that point.\nJust as I ran down the little incline into the open, a bird flew past me across the water, and alighted in a dead spruce (it might\nhave been the very tree of nine days before), where it sat in full sight, and at once broke into song,—\"like the purple finch's,\"\nsays my notebook; \"less fluent, but, as it seemed to me, sweeter and more expressive. I think it was not louder.\" Before many\nminutes, my comrade came running down the path in high glee, calling, \"Pine grosbeaks!\" He had got directly under a tree in which\ntwo of them were sitting. So the momentous question was settled, and I commenced feeling once more a degree of confidence in my\nown eyesight. The loss of such confidence is a serious discomfort; but strange as it may seem to people in general, I suspect that\nfew field ornithologists, except [Pg 30]beginners, ever succeed in retaining it undisturbed for any long time together. As a\nclass, they have learned to take the familiar maxim, \"Seeing is believing,\" with several grains of allowance. With most of them,\nit would be nearer the mark to say, Shooting is believing.\n\nMy special errand at the lakes being thus quickly disposed of, there was no reason why I should not accompany my friend to the\nsummit. Lafayette gave us a cold reception. We might have addressed him as Daniel Webster, according to the time-worn story, once\naddressed Mount Washington; but neither of us felt oratorically inclined. In truth, after the outrageous heats of the past few\ndays, it seemed good to be thrashing our arms and crouching behind a boulder, while we devoured our luncheon, and between times\nstudied the landscape. For my own part, I experienced a feeling of something like wicked satisfaction; as if I had been wronged,\nand all at once had found a way of balancing the score. The diapensia was already quite out of bloom, although only nine days\nbefore we had thought it hardly at its best. It is one of the prettiest and [Pg 31]most striking of our strictly alpine plants,\nbut is seldom seen by the ordinary summer tourist, as it finishes its course long before he arrives. The same may be said of the\nsplendid Lapland azalea, which I do not remember to have found on Mount Lafayette, it is true, but which is to be seen in all its\nglory upon the Mount Washington range, in middle or late June; so early that one may have to travel over snow-banks to reach it.\nThe two flowers oftenest noticed by the chance comer to these parts are the Greenland sandwort (the \"mountain daisy\"!) and the\npretty geum, with its handsome crinkled leaves and its bright yellow blossoms, like buttercups.\n\nMy sketch will hardly fulfill the promise of its title; for our June in Franconia included a thousand things of which I have left\nmyself no room to speak: strolls in the Landaff Valley and to Sugar Hill; a walk to Mount Agassiz; numerous visits—by the way, and\nin uncertain weather—to Bald Mountain; several jaunts to Lonesome Lake; and wanderings here and there in the pathless valley\nwoods. We were none of us of that unhappy class who cannot enjoy doing the same thing twice.\n\n[Pg 32]\n\nI wished, also, to say something of sundry minor enjoyments: of the cinnamon roses, for example, with the fragrance of which we\nwere continually greeted, and which have left such a sweetness in the memory that I would have called this essay \"June in the\nValley of Cinnamon Roses,\" had I not despaired of holding myself up to so poetic a title. And with the roses the wild\nstrawberries present themselves. Roses and strawberries! It is the very poetry of science that these should be classified\ntogether. The berries, like the flowers, are of a generous turn (it is a family trait, I think), loving no place better than the\nroadside, as if they would fain be of refreshment to beings less happy than themselves, who cannot be still and blossom and bear\nfruit, but are driven by the Fates to go trudging up and down in dusty highways. For myself, if I were a dweller in this vale, I\nam sure my finger-tips would never be of their natural color so long as the season of strawberries lasted. On one of my solitary\nrambles I found a retired sunny field, full of them. To judge from appearances, not a soul had been near it. But I noticed that,\nwhile the [Pg 33]almost ripe fruit was abundant, there was scarce any that had taken on the final tinge and flavor. Then I began\nto be aware of faint, sibilant noises about me, and, glancing up, I saw that the ground was already \"preëmpted\" by a company\nof cedar-birds, who, naturally enough, were not a little indignant at my poaching thus on their preserves. They showed so much\nconcern (and had gathered the ripest of the berries so thoroughly) that I actually came away the sooner on their account. I began\nto feel ashamed of myself, and for once in my life was literally hissed off the stage.\n\nEven on my last page I must be permitted a word in praise of Mount Cannon, of which I made three ascents. It has nothing like the\ncelebrity of Mount Willard, with which, from its position, it is natural to compare it; but to my thinking it is little, if at\nall, less worthy. Its outlook upon Mount Lafayette is certainly grander than anything Mount Willard can offer, while the prospect\nof the Pemigewasset Valley, fading away to the horizon, if less striking than that of the White Mountain Notch, has some elements\nof beauty which must of necessity be lacking [Pg 34]in any more narrowly circumscribed scene, no matter how romantic.\n\nIn venturing upon a comparison of this kind, however, one is bound always to allow for differences of mood. When I am in tune for\nsuch things, I can be happier on an ordinary Massachusetts hilltop than at another time I should be on any New Hampshire mountain,\nthough it were Moosilauke itself. And, truly, Fortune did smile upon our first visit to Mount Cannon. Weather conditions, outward\nand inward, were right. We had come mainly to look at Lafayette from this point of vantage; but, while we suffered no\ndisappointment in that direction, we found ourselves still more taken with the valley prospect. We lay upon the rocks by the hour,\ngazing at it.

If the verdict of the villagers could have been taken, we should, perhaps, have been voted a queer set, familiar as dwellers in Franconia are with the sight of idle tourists,&mdash;</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<div><center><small><span>\"Rapid and gay, as if the earth were air,</span><span>And they were butterflies to wheel about</span><span>Long as the summer lasted.\"</span></small></center></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>We were neither \"rapid\" nor \"gay,\" and it was still only the first week of June; if we were summer boarders, therefore, we must be of some unusual early-blooming variety.</p>\r\n<p><span><a></a>[Pg 2]</span></p>\r\n<p>First came a lady, in excellent repute among the savants of Europe and America as an entomologist, but better known to the general public as a writer of stories. With her, as companion and assistant, was a doctor of laws, who is also a newspaper proprietor, a voluminous author, an art connoisseur, and many things beside. They had turned their backs thus unseasonably upon the metropolis, and in this pleasant out-of-the-way corner were devoting themselves to one absorbing pursuit,&mdash;the pursuit of moths. On their daily drives, two or three insect nets dangled conspicuously from the carriage,&mdash;the footman, thrifty soul, was never backward to take a hand,&mdash;and evening after evening the hotel piazza was illuminated till midnight with lamps and lanterns, while these enthusiasts waved the same white nets about, gathering in geometries, noctuids, sphinges, and Heaven knows what else, all of them to perish painlessly in numerous \"cyanide bottles,\" which bestrewed the piazza by night, and (happy thought!) the closed piano by day. In this noble occupation I sometimes played at helping; but with only meagre success, my most&nbsp;<span><a></a>[Pg 3]</span>brilliant catch being nothing more important than a \"beautiful Io.\" The kind-hearted lepidopterist lingered with gracious emphasis upon the adjective, and assured me that the specimen would be all the more valuable because of a finger-mark which my awkwardness had left upon one of its wings. So&mdash;to the credit of human nature be it spoken&mdash;so does amiability sometimes get the better of the feminine scientific spirit. To the credit of human nature, I say; for, though her practice of the romancer's art may doubtless have given to this good lady some peculiar flexibility of mind, some special, individual facility in subordinating a lower truth to a higher, it surely may be affirmed, also, of humanity in general, that few things become it better than its inconsistencies.</p>\r\n<p>Of the four remaining members of the company, two were botanists, and two&mdash;for the time&mdash;ornithologists. But the botanists were lovers of birds, also, and went nowhere without opera-glasses; while the ornithologists, in turn, did not hold themselves above some elementary&nbsp;<span><a></a>[Pg 4]</span>knowledge of plants, and amused themselves with now and then pointing out some rarity&mdash;sedges and willows were the special desiderata&mdash;which the professional collectors seemed in danger of passing without notice. All in all, we&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;a queer set. How the Latin and Greek polysyllables flew about the dining-room, as we recounted our forenoon's or afternoon's discoveries! Somebody remarked once that the waiters' heads appeared to be more or less in danger; but if the waiters trembled at all, it was probably not for their own heads, but for ours.&nbsp;<a></a><a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/27285/27285-h/27285-h.htm#Footnote_1_1\">[1]</a></p>\r\n<p>Our first excursion&mdash;I speak of the four who traveled on foot&mdash;was to the Franconia Notch. It could not well have been otherwise; at all events, there was one of the four&nbsp;<span><a></a>[Pg 5]</span>whose feet would not willingly have carried him in any other direction. The mountains drew us, and there was no thought of resisting their attraction.</p>\r\n<p>Love and curiosity are different, if not incompatible, sentiments; and the birds that are dearest to the man are, for that very reason, not most interesting to the ornithologist. When on a journey, I am almost without eyes or ears for bluebirds and robins, song sparrows and chickadees. Now is my opportunity for extending my acquaintance, and such every-day favorites must get along for the time as best they can without my attention. So it was here in Franconia. The&nbsp;<a></a>vesper sparrow, the veery, and a host of other friends were singing about the hotel and along the roadside, but we heeded them not. Our case was like the boy's who declined gingerbread, when on a visit: he had plenty of that at home.</p>\r\n<p>When we were nearly at the edge of the mountain woods, however, we heard across the field a few notes that brought all four of us to an instant standstill. What&nbsp;<a></a>warbler&nbsp;could that be? Nobody could tell. In fact, nobody could guess. But, before&nbsp;<span><a></a>[Pg 6]</span>the youngest of us could surmount the wall, the singer took wing, flew over our heads far into the woods, and all was silent. It was too bad; but there would be another day to-morrow. Meantime, we kept on up the hill, and soon were in the old forest, listening to&nbsp;<a></a>bay-breasted warblers,&nbsp;<a></a>Blackburnians,&nbsp;<a></a>black-polls, and so on, while the noise of the mountain brook on our right, a better singer than any of them, was never out of our ears. \"You are going up,\" it said. \"I wish you joy. But you see how it is; you will soon have to come down again.\"</p>\r\n<p>I took leave of my companions at Profile Lake, they having planned an all-day excursion beyond, and started homeward by myself. Slowly, and with many stops, I sauntered down the long hill, through the forest (the stops, I need not say, are commonly the major part of a naturalist's ramble,&mdash;the golden beads, as it were, the walk itself being only the string), till I reached the spot where we had been serenaded in the morning by our&nbsp;<a></a>mysterious stranger. Yes, he was again singing, this time not far from the road, in a moderately thick growth of small trees, under which the ground was&nbsp;<span><a></a>[Pg 7]</span>carpeted with club-mosses, dog-tooth violets, clintonia, linn&aelig;a, and similar plants. He continued to sing, and I continued to edge my way nearer and nearer, till finally I was near enough, and went down on my knees. Then I saw him, facing me, showing white under parts. A Tennessee warbler! Here was good luck indeed. I ogled him for a long time (\"Shoot it,\" says Mr. Burroughs, authoritatively, \"not ogle it with a glass;\" but a man must follow his own method), impatient to see his back, and especially the top of his head. What a precious frenzy we fall into at such moments! My knees were fairly upon nettles. He flew, and I followed. Once more he was under the glass, but still facing me. How like a vireo he looked! For one instant I thought, Can it be the Philadelphia vireo? But, though I had never seen that bird, I knew its song to be as different as possible from the notes to which I was listening. After a long time the fellow turned to feeding, and now I obtained a look at his upper parts,&mdash;the back olive, the head ashy, like the Nashville warbler. That was enough. It was indeed the Tennessee (<em>Helminthophila peregrina</em>),&nbsp;<span><a></a>[Pg 8]</span>a bird for which I had been ten years on the watch.</p>\r\n<p>The song, which has not often been described, is more suggestive of the&nbsp;<a></a>Nashville's&nbsp;than of any other, but so decidedly different as never for a moment to be confounded with it. \"When you hear it,\" a friend had said to me several years before, \"you will know it for something new.\" It is long (I speak comparatively, of course), very sprightly, and peculiarly staccato, and is made up of two parts, the second quicker in movement and higher in pitch than the first. I speak of it as in two parts, though when my companions came to hear it, as they did the next day, they reported it as in three. We visited the place together afterwards, and the discrepancy was readily explained. As to pitch, the song&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;in three parts, but as to rhythm and character, it is in two; the first half being composed of double notes, the second of single notes. The resemblance to the Nashville's song lies entirely in the first part; the notes of the concluding portion are not run together or jumbled, after the Nashville's manner, but are quite as distinct as those of the opening measure.</p>\r\n<p><span><a></a>[Pg 9]</span></p>\r\n<p>As there were at least two pairs of the birds, and they were unmistakably at home, we naturally had hope of finding one of the nests. We made several random attempts, and one day I devoted an hour or more to a really methodical search; but the wily singer gave me not the slightest clue, behaving as if there were no such thing as a bird's nest within a thousand miles, and all my endeavors went for nothing.</p>\r\n<p>As might have been foreseen, Franconia proved to be an excellent place in which to study the difficult family of flycatchers. All our common eastern Massachusetts species were present,&mdash;the&nbsp;<a></a>kingbird, the&nbsp;<a></a>ph&oelig;be, the&nbsp;<a></a>wood pewee, and the&nbsp;<a></a>least flycatcher,&mdash;and with them the&nbsp;<a></a>crested flycatcher&nbsp;(not common), the&nbsp;<a></a>olive-sided, the&nbsp;<a></a>traill, and the&nbsp;<a></a>yellow-bellied. The ph&oelig;be-like cry of the traill was to be heard constantly from the hotel piazza. The yellow-bellied seemed to be confined to deep and rather swampy woods in the valley, and to the mountain-side forests; being most numerous on Mount Lafayette, where it ran well up toward the limit of trees. In his notes, the yellow-belly may be said to take&nbsp;<span><a></a>[Pg 10]</span>after both the least flycatcher and the wood pewee. His&nbsp;<em>killic</em>&nbsp;(so written in the books, and I do not know how to improve upon it) resembles the&nbsp;<em>chebec</em>&nbsp;of the least flycatcher, though much less emphatic, as well as much less frequently uttered, while his&nbsp;<em>twee</em>, or&nbsp;<em>tuwee</em>, is quite in the voice and manner of the wood pewee's clear, plaintive whistle; usually a monosyllable, but at other times almost or quite dissyllabic. The&nbsp;<a></a>olive-sided, on the other hand, imitates nobody; or, if he does, it must be some bird with which I have yet to make acquaintance.&nbsp;<em>Que-q&uacute;e-o</em>&nbsp;he vociferates, with a strong emphasis and drawl upon the middle syllable. This is his song, or what answers to a song, but I have seen him when he would do nothing but repeat incessantly a quick trisyllabic call,&nbsp;<em>whit, whit, whit</em>; corresponding, I suppose, to the well-known&nbsp;<em>whit</em>&nbsp;with which the&nbsp;<a></a>ph&oelig;be&nbsp;sometimes busies himself in a similar manner.</p>\r\n<p>Of more interest than any flycatcher&mdash;of more interest even than the Tennessee warbler&mdash;was a bird found by the roadside in the village, after we had been for several days in the place. Three of us were&nbsp;<span><a></a>[Pg 11]</span>walking together, talking by the way, when all at once we halted, as by a common impulse, at the sound of a vireo song; a&nbsp;<a></a>red-eye's&nbsp;song, as it seemed, with the faintest touch of something unfamiliar about it. The singer was in a small butternut-tree close upon the sidewalk, and at once afforded us perfectly satisfactory observations, perching on a low limb within fifteen feet of our eyes, and singing again and again, while we scrutinized every feather through our glasses. As one of my companions said, it was like having the bird in your hand. There was no room for a question as to its identity. At last we had before us the rare and long-desired&nbsp;<a></a>Philadelphia greenlet. As its song is little known, I here transcribe my notes about it, made at two different times, between which there appears to have been some discussion among us as to just how it should be characterized:&mdash;</p>\r\n<p>\"The song is very pretty, and is curiously compounded of the red-eye's and the&nbsp;<a></a>solitary's, both as to phrase and quality. The measures are all brief; with fewer syllables, that is to say, than the red-eye commonly uses. Some of them are exactly like the<span><a></a>[Pg 12]</span>&nbsp;red-eye's, while others have the peculiar sweet upward inflection of the solitary's. To hear some of the measures, you would pass the bird for a red-eye; to hear others of them, you might pass him for a solitary. At the same time, he has not the most highly characteristic of the solitary's phrases. His voice is less sharp and his accent less emphatic than the red-eye's, and, so far as we heard, he observes decidedly longer rests between the measures.\"</p>\r\n<p>This is under date of June 16th. On the following day I made another entry:&mdash;</p>\r\n<p>\"The song is, I think, less varied than either the solitary's or the red-eye's, but it grows more distinct from both as it is longer heard. Acquaintance will probably make it as characteristic and unmistakable as any of our four other vireo songs. But I do not withdraw what I said yesterday about its resemblance to the red-eye's and the solitary's. The bird seems quite fearless, and keeps much of the time in the lower branches. In this latter respect his habit is in contrast with that of the warbling vireo.\"</p>\r\n<p>On the whole, then, the song of the Philadelphia vireo comes nearest to the red-eye's,<span><a></a>[Pg 13]</span>&nbsp;differing from it mainly in tone and inflection rather than in form. In these two respects it suggests the&nbsp;<a></a>solitary vireo, though it never reproduces the indescribably sweet cadence, the real \"dying fall,\" of that most delightful songster. At the risk of a seeming contradiction, however, I must mention one curious circumstance. On going again to Franconia, a year afterwards, and, naturally, keeping my ears open for&nbsp;<em>Vireo philadelphicus</em>, I discovered that I was never for a moment in doubt when I heard a red-eye; but once, on listening to a distant solitary,&mdash;catching only part of the strain,&mdash;I was for a little quite uncertain whether he might not be the bird for which I was looking. How this fact is to be explained I am unable to say; it will be least surprising to those who know most of such matters, and at all events I think it worth recording as affording a possible clue to some future observer. The experience, inconsistent as the assertion may sound, does not in the least alter my opinion that the Philadelphia's song is practically certain to be confused with the red-eye's rather than with the solitary's. Upon that point my companions&nbsp;<span><a></a>[Pg 14]</span>and I were perfectly agreed while we had the bird before us, and Mr. Brewster's testimony is abundantly conclusive to the same effect. He was in the Umbagog forests on a special hunt for Philadelphia vireos (he had collected specimens there on two previous occasions), and after some days of fruitless search discovered, almost by accident, that the birds had all the while been singing close about him, but in every instance had passed for \"nothing but red-eyes.\"<a></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/27285/27285-h/27285-h.htm#Footnote_2_2\">[2]</a></p>\r\n<p>For the benefit of the lay reader, I ought, perhaps, to have explained before this that the Philadelphia vireo is in coloration an exact copy of the&nbsp;<a></a>warbling vireo. There is a slight difference in size between the two, but the most practiced eye could not be depended upon to tell them apart in a tree.&nbsp;<em>Vireo philadelphicus</em>&nbsp;is in a peculiar case: it looks like one common bird, and sings like another. It might have been invented on purpose to circumvent collectors, as the Almighty has been supposed by some to have created fossils on purpose to deceive ungodly geologists. It is not surprising, therefore, that the bird escaped the notice&nbsp;<span><a></a>[Pg 15]</span>of the older ornithologists. In fact, it was first described,&mdash;by Mr. Cassin,&mdash;in 1851, from a specimen taken, nine years before, near Philadelphia; and its nest remained unknown for more than thirty years longer, the first one having been discovered, apparently in Canada, in 1884.<a></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/27285/27285-h/27285-h.htm#Footnote_3_3\">[3]</a></p>\r\n<p>Day after day, the bare, sharp crest of&nbsp;<a></a>Mount Lafayette&nbsp;silently invited my feet. Then came a bright, favorable morning, and I set out. I would go alone on this my first pilgrimage to the noble peak, at which, always from too far off, I had gazed longingly for ten summers. It is not inconsistent with a proper regard for one's fellows, I trust, to enjoy now and then being without their society. It&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;good, sometimes, for a man to be alone,&mdash;especially on a mountain-top, and more especially at a first visit. The trip to the summit was some seven or eight miles in length, and an almost continual ascent, without a dull step in the whole distance. The Tennessee warbler was singing; but perhaps the pleasantest incident of the walk to the Profile House&mdash;in front of which the mountain footpath is taken&mdash;was&nbsp;<span><a></a>[Pg 16]</span>a&nbsp;<a></a>Blackburnian warbler&nbsp;perched, as usual, at the very top of a tall spruce, his orange throat flashing fire as he faced the sun, and his song, as my notebook expresses it, \"sliding up to high&nbsp;<em>Z</em>&nbsp;at the end\" in his quaintest and most characteristic fashion. I spent nearly three hours in climbing the mountain path, and during all that time saw and heard only twelve kinds of birds:&nbsp;<a></a>redstarts,&nbsp;<a></a>Canada warblers&nbsp;(near the base),&nbsp;<a></a>black-throated blues,&nbsp;<a></a>black-throated greens,&nbsp;<a></a>Nashvilles,&nbsp;<a></a>black-polls, red-eyed vireos, snowbirds (no&nbsp;<a></a>white-throated sparrows!), winter wrens, Swainson and&nbsp;<a></a>gray-cheeked thrushes, and yellow-bellied flycatchers. Black-poll and Nashville warblers were especially numerous, as they are also upon Mount Washington, and, as far as I have seen, upon the White Mountains generally. The feeble, sharp song of the black-poll is a singular affair; short and slight as it is, it embraces a perfect crescendo and a perfect decrescendo. Without question I passed plenty of white-throated sparrows, but by some coincidence not one of them announced himself. The gray-cheeked thrushes, which sang freely, were not heard till I was&nbsp;<span><a></a>[Pg 17]</span>perhaps halfway between the Eagle Cliff Notch and the Eagle Lakes. This species, so recently added to our summer fauna, proves to be not uncommon in the mountainous parts of New England, though apparently confined to the spruce forests at or near the summits. I found it abundant on Mount Mansfield, Vermont, in 1885, and in the summer of 1888 Mr. Walter Faxon surprised us all by shooting a specimen on Mount Graylock, Massachusetts. Doubtless the bird has been singing its perfectly distinctive song in the White Mountain woods ever since the white man first visited them. During the vernal migration, indeed, I have more than once heard it sing in eastern Massachusetts. My latest delightful experience of this kind was on the 29th of May last (1889), while I was hastening to a railway train within the limits of Boston. Preoccupied as I was, and faintly as the notes came to me, I recognized them instantly; for while the gray-cheek's song bears an evident resemblance to the&nbsp;<a></a>veery's&nbsp;(which I had heard within five minutes), the two are so unlike in pitch and rhythm that no reasonably nice ear ought ever to&nbsp;<span><a></a>[Pg 18]</span>confound them. The bird was just over the high, close, inhospitable fence, on the top of which I rested my chin and watched and listened. He sat with his back toward me, in full view, on a level with my eye, and sang and sang and sang, in a most deliciously soft, far-away voice, keeping his wings all the while a little raised and quivering, as in a kind of musical ecstasy. It does seem a thing to be regretted&mdash;yes, a thing to be ashamed of&mdash;that a bird so beautiful, so musical, so romantic in its choice of a dwelling-place, and withal so characteristic of New England should be known, at a liberal estimate, to not more than one or two hundred New Englanders! But if a bird wishes general recognition, he should do as the robin does, and the bluebird, and the oriole,&mdash;dress like none of his neighbors, and show himself freely in the vicinity of men's houses. How can one expect to be famous unless he takes a little pains to keep himself before the public?</p>\r\n<p>From the time I left my hotel until I was fairly above the dwarf spruces below the summit of Lafayette, I was never for many minutes together out of the hearing of thrush&nbsp;<span><a></a>[Pg 19]</span>music. Four of our five summer representatives of the genus&nbsp;<em>Turdus</em>&nbsp;took turns, as it were, in the serenade. The&nbsp;<a></a>veeries&mdash;Wilson's thrushes&mdash;greeted me before I stepped off the piazza. As I neared the Profile House farm, the&nbsp;<a></a>hermits&nbsp;were in tune on either hand. The moment the road entered the ancient forest, the&nbsp;<a></a>olive-backs&nbsp;began to make themselves heard, and halfway up the mountain path the&nbsp;<a></a>gray-cheeks&nbsp;took up the strain and carried it on to its heavenly conclusion. A noble processional! Even a lame man might have climbed to such music. If the wood thrush had been here, the chorus would have been complete,&mdash;a chorus not to be excelled, according to my untraveled belief, in any quarter of the world.</p>\r\n<p>To-day, however, my first thoughts were not of birds, but of the mountain. The weather was all that could be asked,&mdash;the temperature perfect, and the atmosphere so transparent as to be of itself a kind of lens; so that in the evening, when I rejoined my companions at the hotel, I found to my astonishment that I had been plainly visible while at the summit, the beholders having&nbsp;<span><a></a>[Pg 20]</span>no other help than an opera-glass! It was almost past belief. I had felt some dilation of soul, it was true, but had been quite unconscious of any corresponding physical transformation. What would our aboriginal forerunners have said could they have stood in the valley and seen a human form moving from point to point along yonder sharp, serrated ridge? I should certainly have passed for a god! Let us be thankful that all such superstitious fancies have had their day. The Indian, poor child of nature,</p>\r\n<p><small>\"A pagan suckled in a creed outworn,\"</small></p>\r\n<p>stood afar off and worshiped toward these holy hills; but the white man clambers gayly up their sides, guide-book in hand, and leaves his sardine box and eggshells&mdash;and likely enough his business card&mdash;at the top. Let us be thankful, I repeat, for the light vouchsafed to us; ours is a goodly heritage; but there are moods&mdash;such creatures of hereditary influence are we&mdash;wherein I would gladly exchange both the guide-book and the sardine box for a vision, never so indistinct and transient, of Kitche Manitoo. Alas! what a long time it is since any of us&nbsp;<span><a></a>[Pg 21]</span>have been able to see the invisible. \"In the mountains,\" says Wordsworth, \"did he feel his faith.\" But the poet was speaking then of a very old-fashioned young fellow, who, even when he grew up, made nothing but a peddler. Had he lived in our day, he would have felt not his faith, but his own importance; especially if he had put himself out of breath, as most likely he would have done, in accomplishing in an hour and forty minutes what, according to the guide-book, should have taken a full hour and three quarters. The modern excursionist (how Wordsworth would have loved that word!) has learned wisdom of a certain wise fowl who once taught St. Peter a lesson, and who never finds himself in a high place without an impulse to flap his wings and crow.</p>\r\n<p>For my own part, though I spent nearly three hours on the less than four miles of mountain path, as I have already acknowledged, I was nevertheless somewhat short-winded at the end. So long as I was in the woods, it was easy enough to loiter; but no sooner did I leave the last low spruces behind me than I was seized with an importunate desire to stand upon the peak, so near&nbsp;<span><a></a>[Pg 22]</span>at hand just above me. I hope my readers are none of them too old to sympathize with the boyish feeling. At all events, I quickened my pace. The distance could not be more than half a mile, I thought. But it was wonderful how that perverse trail among the boulders did unwind itself, as if it never would come to an end; and I was not surprised, on consulting a guide-book afterwards, to find that my half mile had really been a mile and a half. One's sensations in such a case I have sometimes compared with those of an essay-writer when he is getting near the end of his task. He dallied with it in the beginning, and was half ready to throw it up in the middle; but now the fever is on him, and he cannot drive the pen fast enough. Two days ago he doubted whether or not to burn the thing; now it is certain to be his masterpiece, and he must sit up till morning, if need be, to finish it. What would life be worth without its occasional enthusiasm, laughable in the retrospect, perhaps, but in itself pleasurable almost to the point of painfulness?</p>\r\n<p>It was a glorious day. I enjoyed the climb, the lessening forest, the&nbsp;<a></a>alpine&nbsp;<span><a></a>[Pg 23]</span>plants (the&nbsp;<a></a>diapensia&nbsp;was in full flower, with its upright snowy goblets, while the&nbsp;<a></a>geum&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a></a>Greenland sandwort&nbsp;were just beginning to blossom), the magnificent prospect, the stimulating air, and, most of all, the mountain itself. I sympathized then, as I have often done at other times, with a remark once made to me by a Vermont farmer's wife. I had sought a night's lodging at her house, and during the evening we fell into conversation about Mount Mansfield, from the top of which I had just come, and directly at the base of which the farmhouse stood. When she went up \"the mounting,\" she said, she liked to look off, of course; but somehow what she cared most about was \"the mounting itself.\"</p>\r\n<p>The woman had probably never read a line of Wordsworth, unless possibly, \"We are Seven\" was in the old school reader; but I am sure the poet would have liked this saying, especially as coming from such a source.&nbsp;<em>I</em>&nbsp;liked it, at any rate, and am seldom on a mountain-top without recalling it. Her lot had been narrow and prosaic,&mdash;bitterly so, the visitor was likely to think; she was little used to expressing herself, and&nbsp;<span><a></a>[Pg 24]</span>no doubt would have wondered what Mr. Pater could mean by his talk about natural objects as possessing \"more or less of a moral or spiritual life,\" as \"capable of a companionship with man, full of expression, of inexplicable affinities and delicacies of intercourse.\" From such refinements and subtleties her mind would have taken refuge in thoughts of her baking and ironing. But she enjoyed the mountain; I think she had some feeling for it, as for a friend; and who knows but she, too, was one of \"the poets that are sown by Nature\"?</p>\r\n<p>I spent two happy hours and a half at the summit of&nbsp;<a></a>Lafayette. The ancient peak must have had many a worthier guest, but it could never have entertained one more hospitably. With what softly temperate breezes did it fan me! I wish I were there now! But kind as was its welcome, it did not urge me to remain. The word of the brook came true again,&mdash;as Nature's words always do, if we hear them aright. Having gone as high as my feet could carry me, there was nothing left but to go down again. \"Which things,\" as Paul said to the Galatians, \"are an allegory.\"</p>\r\n<p><span><a></a>[Pg 25]</span></p>\r\n<p>I was not asked to stay, but I was invited to come again; and the next season, also in June, I twice accepted the invitation. On the first of these occasions, although I was eight days later than I had been the year before (June 19th instead of June 11th), the&nbsp;<a></a>diapensia&nbsp;was just coming into somewhat free bloom, while the&nbsp;<a></a>sandwort&nbsp;showed only here and there a stray flower, and the&nbsp;<a></a>geum&nbsp;was only in bud. The dwarf paper birch (trees of no one knows what age, matting the ground) was in blossom, with large, handsome catkins, while Cutler's willow was already in fruit, and the crowberry likewise. The willow, like the birch, has learned that the only way to live in such a place is to lie flat upon the ground and let the wind blow over you. The other flowers noted at the summit were one of the blueberries (<em>Vaccinium uliginosum</em>), Bigelow's sedge, and the fragrant alpine&nbsp;<a></a>holy-grass (<em>Hierochloa alpina</em>). Why should this sacred grass, which Christians sprinkle in front of their church doors on feast-days, be scattered thus upon our higher mountain-tops, unless these places are indeed, as the Indian and the ancient Hebrew believed, the special abode of the Great Spirit?</p>\r\n<p><span><a></a>[Pg 26]</span></p>\r\n<p>But the principal interest of this my second ascent of Mount Lafayette was to be not botanical, but ornithological. We had seen nothing noteworthy on the way up (I was not alone this time, though I have so far been rude enough to ignore my companion); but while at the Eagle Lakes, on our return, we had an experience that threw me into a nine days' fever. The other man&mdash;one of the botanists of last year's crew&mdash;was engaged in collecting viburnum specimens, when all at once I caught sight of something red in a dead spruce on the mountain-side just across the tiny lake. I leveled my glass, and saw with perfect distinctness, as I thought, two&nbsp;<a></a>pine grosbeaks&nbsp;in bright male costume,&mdash;birds I had never seen before except in winter. Presently a third one, in dull plumage, came into view, having been hidden till now behind the bole. The trio remained in sight for some time, and then dropped into the living spruces underneath, and disappeared. I lingered about, while my companion and the black flies were busy, and was on the point of turning away for good, when up flew two red birds and alighted in a tree close by the&nbsp;<span><a></a>[Pg 27]</span>one out of which the grosbeaks had dropped. But a single glance showed that they were not grosbeaks, but&nbsp;<a></a>white-winged crossbills! And soon they, too, were joined by a third bird, in female garb. Here was a pretty piece of confusion! I was delighted to see the crossbills, having never before had the first glimpse of them, summer or winter; but what was I to think about the grosbeaks? \"Your determination is worthless,\" said my scientific friend, consolingly; and there was no gainsaying his verdict. Yet by what possibility could I have been so deceived? The birds, though none too near, had given me an excellent observation, and as long as they were in sight I had felt no uncertainty whatever as to their identity. The bill alone, of which I had taken particular note, ought in all reason to be held conclusive. So much for one side of the case. On the other hand, however, the second trio were unmistakably crossbills. (They had been joined on the wing by several others, as I ought to have mentioned, and with their characteristic chattering cry had swept out of sight up the mountain). It was certainly a curious coincidence: three&nbsp;<span><a></a>[Pg 28]</span>grosbeaks&mdash;two males and a female&mdash;had dropped out of a tree into the undergrowth; and then, five minutes later, three crossbills&mdash;two males and a female&mdash;had risen out of the same undergrowth, and taken almost the very perch which the others had quitted! Had this strange thing happened? Or had my eyes deceived me? This was my dilemma, on the sharp horns of which I tried alternately for the next eight days to make myself comfortable.</p>\r\n<p>During all that time, the weather rendered mountain climbing impracticable. But the morning of the 28th was clear and cold, and I set out forthwith for the Eagle Lakes. If the grosbeaks were there, I meant to see them, though I should have to spend all day in the attempt. My botanist had returned home, leaving me quite alone at the hotel; but, as good fortune would have it, before I reached the Profile House, I was overtaken unexpectedly by a young ornithological friend, who needed no urging to try the Lafayette path. We were creeping laboriously up the long, steep shoulder beyond the Eagle Cliff gorge, and drawing near the lakes, when all at once a peculiarly sweet, flowing&nbsp;<span><a></a>[Pg 29]</span>warble fell upon our ears. \"A pine grosbeak!\" said I, in a tone of full assurance, although this was my first hearing of the song. The younger man plunged into the forest, in the direction of the voice, while I, knowing pretty well how the land lay, hastened on toward the lakes, in hopes to find the singer visible from that point. Just as I ran down the little incline into the open, a bird flew past me across the water, and alighted in a dead spruce (it might have been the very tree of nine days before), where it sat in full sight, and at once broke into song,&mdash;\"like the purple finch's,\" says my notebook; \"less fluent, but, as it seemed to me, sweeter and more expressive. I think it was not louder.\" Before many minutes, my comrade came running down the path in high glee, calling, \"Pine grosbeaks!\" He had got directly under a tree in which two of them were sitting. So the momentous question was settled, and I commenced feeling once more a degree of confidence in my own eyesight. The loss of such confidence is a serious discomfort; but strange as it may seem to people in general, I suspect that few field ornithologists, except&nbsp;<span><a></a>[Pg 30]</span>beginners, ever succeed in retaining it undisturbed for any long time together. As a class, they have learned to take the familiar maxim, \"Seeing is believing,\" with several grains of allowance. With most of them, it would be nearer the mark to say, Shooting is believing.</p>\r\n<p>My special errand at the lakes being thus quickly disposed of, there was no reason why I should not accompany my friend to the summit. Lafayette gave us a cold reception. We might have addressed him as Daniel Webster, according to the time-worn story, once addressed Mount Washington; but neither of us felt oratorically inclined. In truth, after the outrageous heats of the past few days, it seemed good to be thrashing our arms and crouching behind a boulder, while we devoured our luncheon, and between times studied the landscape. For my own part, I experienced a feeling of something like wicked satisfaction; as if I had been wronged, and all at once had found a way of balancing the score. The&nbsp;<a></a>diapensia&nbsp;was already quite out of bloom, although only nine days before we had thought it hardly at its best. It is one of the prettiest and&nbsp;<span><a></a>[Pg 31]</span>most striking of our strictly alpine plants, but is seldom seen by the ordinary summer tourist, as it finishes its course long before he arrives. The same may be said of the splendid&nbsp;<a></a>Lapland azalea, which I do not remember to have found on Mount Lafayette, it is true, but which is to be seen in all its glory upon the Mount Washington range, in middle or late June; so early that one may have to travel over snow-banks to reach it. The two flowers oftenest noticed by the chance comer to these parts are the&nbsp;<a></a>Greenland sandwort&nbsp;(the \"mountain daisy\"!) and the pretty&nbsp;<a></a>geum, with its handsome crinkled leaves and its bright yellow blossoms, like buttercups.</p>\r\n<p>My sketch will hardly fulfill the promise of its title; for our June in Franconia included a thousand things of which I have left myself no room to speak: strolls in the Landaff Valley and to Sugar Hill; a walk to Mount Agassiz; numerous visits&mdash;by the way, and in uncertain weather&mdash;to Bald Mountain; several jaunts to Lonesome Lake; and wanderings here and there in the pathless valley woods. We were none of us of that unhappy class who cannot enjoy doing the same thing twice.</p>\r\n<p><span><a></a>[Pg 32]</span></p>\r\n<p>I wished, also, to say something of sundry minor enjoyments: of the cinnamon roses, for example, with the fragrance of which we were continually greeted, and which have left such a sweetness in the memory that I would have called this essay \"June in the Valley of Cinnamon Roses,\" had I not despaired of holding myself up to so poetic a title. And with the roses the&nbsp;<a></a>wild strawberries&nbsp;present themselves.&nbsp;<a></a>Roses&nbsp;and strawberries! It is the very poetry of science that these should be classified together. The berries, like the flowers, are of a generous turn (it is a family trait, I think), loving no place better than the roadside, as if they would fain be of refreshment to beings less happy than themselves, who cannot be still and blossom and bear fruit, but are driven by the Fates to go trudging up and down in dusty highways. For myself, if I were a dweller in this vale, I am sure my finger-tips would never be of their natural color so long as the season of strawberries lasted. On one of my solitary rambles I found a retired sunny field, full of them. To judge from appearances, not a soul had been near it. But I noticed that, while the&nbsp;<span><a></a>[Pg 33]</span>almost ripe fruit was abundant, there was scarce any that had taken on the final tinge and flavor. Then I began to be aware of faint, sibilant noises about me, and, glancing up, I saw that the ground was already \"pre&euml;mpted\" by a company of&nbsp;<a></a>cedar-birds, who, naturally enough, were not a little indignant at my poaching thus on their preserves. They showed so much concern (and had gathered the ripest of the berries so thoroughly) that I actually came away the sooner on their account. I began to feel ashamed of myself, and for once in my life was literally hissed off the stage.</p>\r\n<p>Even on my last page I must be permitted a word in praise of&nbsp;<a></a>Mount Cannon, of which I made three ascents. It has nothing like the celebrity of Mount Willard, with which, from its position, it is natural to compare it; but to my thinking it is little, if at all, less worthy. Its outlook upon Mount Lafayette is certainly grander than anything Mount Willard can offer, while the prospect of the Pemigewasset Valley, fading away to the horizon, if less striking than that of the White Mountain Notch, has some elements of beauty which must of necessity be lacking&nbsp;<span><a></a>[Pg 34]</span>in any more narrowly circumscribed scene, no matter how romantic.</p>\r\n<p>In venturing upon a comparison of this kind, however, one is bound always to allow for differences of mood. When I am in tune for such things, I can be happier on an ordinary Massachusetts hilltop than at another time I should be on any New Hampshire mountain, though it were Moosilauke itself. And, truly, Fortune did smile upon our first visit to Mount Cannon. Weather conditions, outward and inward, were right. We had come mainly to look at Lafayette from this point of vantage; but, while we suffered no disappointment in that direction, we found ourselves still more taken with the valley prospect. We lay upon the rocks by the hour, gazing at it. Scattered clouds dappled the whole vast landscape with shadows; the river, winding down the middle of the scene, drew the whole into harmony, as it were, making it in some nobly literal sense picturesque; while the distance was of such an exquisite blue as I think I never saw before.</p>",

  "title": "History of the United States",
  "shortDescription": "History of the United States by Charles A. Beard and Mary Ritter Beard\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\nAs things now stand, the course of instruction in American history in our public schools embraces three distinct treatments of the subject. Three separate books are used. First, there is the primary book, which is usually a very condensed narrative with emphasis on biographies and anecdotes. Second, there is the advanced text for the seventh or eighth grade, generally speaking, an expansion of the elementary book by the addition of forty or fifty thousand words. Finally, there is the high school manual. This, too, ordinarily follows the beaten path, giving fuller accounts of the same events and characters. To put it bluntly, we do not assume that our children obtain permanent possessions from their study of history in the lower grades. If mathematicians followed the same method, high school texts on algebra and geometry would include the multiplication table and fractions.\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, a ready answer to the criticism advanced above. It is that teachers have learned from bitter experience how little history their pupils retain as they pass along the regular route. No teacher of history will deny this. Still it is a standing challenge to existing methods of historical instruction. If the study of history cannot be made truly progressive like the study of mathematics, science, and languages, then the historians assume a grave responsibility in adding their subject to the already overloaded curriculum. If the successive historical texts are only enlarged editions of the first text—more facts, more dates, more words—then history deserves most of the sharp criticism which it is receiving from teachers of science, civics, and economics.\r\n\r\nIn this condition of affairs we find our justification for offering a new high school text in American history. Our first contribution is one of omission. The time-honored stories of exploration and the biographies of heroes are left out. We frankly hold that, if pupils know little or nothing about Columbus, Cortes, Magellan, or Captain John Smith by the time they reach the high school, it is useless to tell the same stories for perhaps the fourth time. It is worse than useless. It is an offense against the teachers of those subjects that are demonstrated to be progressive in character.\r\n\r\nIn the next place we have omitted all descriptions of battles. Our reasons for this are simple. The strategy of a campaign or of a single battle is a highly technical, and usually a highly controversial, matter about which experts differ widely. In the field of military and naval operations most writers and teachers of history are mere novices. To dispose of Gettysburg or the Wilderness in ten lines or ten pages is equally absurd to the serious student of military affairs. Any one who compares the ordinary textbook account of a single Civil War campaign with the account given by Ropes, for instance, will ask for no further comment. No youth called upon to serve our country in arms would think of turning to a high school manual for information about the art of warfare. The dramatic scene or episode, so useful in arousing the interest of the immature pupil, seems out of place in a book that deliberately appeals to boys and girls on the very threshold of life's serious responsibilities.\r\n\r\nIt is not upon negative features, however, that we rest our case. It is rather upon constructive features.\r\n\r\nWe have deliberately aimed at standards of maturity. The study of a mere narrative calls mainly for the use of the memory. We have aimed to stimulate habits of analysis, comparison, association, reflection, and generalization—habits calculated to enlarge as well as inform the mind. We have been at great pains to make our text clear, simple, and direct; but we have earnestly sought to stretch the intellects of our readers—to put them upon their mettle. Most of them will receive the last of their formal instruction in the high school. The world will soon expect maturity from them. Their achievements will depend upon the possession of other powers than memory alone. The effectiveness of their citizenship in our republic will be measured by the excellence of their judgment as well as the fullness of their information.\r\n\r\nC.A.B.\r\nM.R.B.",
  "contentText": "PART I. THE COLONIAL PERIOD\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nTHE GREAT MIGRATION TO AMERICA\n\nThe tide of migration that set in toward the shores of North America during the early years of the seventeenth century was but one\nphase in the restless and eternal movement of mankind upon the surface of the earth. The ancient Greeks flung out their colonies\nin every direction, westward as far as Gaul, across the Mediterranean, and eastward into Asia Minor, perhaps to the very confines\nof India. The Romans, supported by their armies and their government, spread their dominion beyond the narrow lands of Italy until\nit stretched from the heather of Scotland to the sands of Arabia. The Teutonic tribes, from their home beyond the Danube and the\nRhine, poured into the empire of the Cæsars and made the beginnings of modern Europe. Of this great sweep of races and empires the\nsettlement of America was merely a part. And it was, moreover, only one aspect of the expansion which finally carried the peoples,\nthe institutions, and the trade of Europe to the very ends of the earth.\n\nIn one vital point, it must be noted, American colonization differed from that of the ancients. The Greeks usually carried with\nthem affection for the government they left behind and sacred fire from the altar of the parent city; but thousands of the\nimmigrants who came to America disliked the state and disowned the church of the mother country. They established compacts of\ngovernment for themselves and set up altars of their own. They sought not only new soil to till but also political and religious\nliberty for themselves and their children.\n\n\nTHE AGENCIES OF AMERICAN COLONIZATION\n\nIt was no light matter for the English to cross three thousand miles of water and found homes in the American wilderness at the\nopening of the seventeenth century. Ships, tools, and supplies called for huge outlays of money. Stores had to be furnished in\nquantities sufficient to sustain the life of the settlers until they could gather harvests of their own. Artisans and laborers of\nskill and industry had to be induced to risk the hazards of the new world. Soldiers were required for defense and mariners for the\nexploration of inland waters. Leaders of good judgment, adept in managing men, had to be discovered. Altogether such an enterprise\ndemanded capital larger than the ordinary merchant or gentleman could amass and involved risks more imminent than he dared to\nassume. Though in later days, after initial tests had been made, wealthy proprietors were able to establish colonies on their own\naccount, it was the corporation that furnished the capital and leadership in the beginning.\n\nThe Trading Company.—English pioneers in exploration found an instrument for colonization in companies of merchant adventurers,\nwhich had long been employed in carrying on commerce with foreign countries. Such a corporation was composed of many persons of\ndifferent ranks of society—noblemen, merchants, and gentlemen—who banded together for a particular undertaking, each contributing\na sum of money and sharing in the profits of the venture. It was organized under royal authority; it received its charter, its\ngrant of land, and its trading privileges from the king and carried on its operations under his supervision and control. The\ncharter named all the persons originally included in the corporation and gave them certain powers in the management of its\naffairs, including the right to admit new members. The company was in fact a little government set up by the king. When the\nmembers of the corporation remained in England, as in the case of the Virginia Company, they operated through agents sent to the\ncolony. When they came over the seas themselves and settled in America, as in the case of Massachusetts, they became the direct\ngovernment of the country they possessed. The stockholders in that instance became the voters and the governor, the chief\nmagistrate.\n\n\nJohn Winthrop, Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Company [https://www.gutenberg.org/files/16960/16960-h/images/17.jpg]\nJohn Winthrop, Governor of the\nMassachusetts Bay Company\n\nFour of the thirteen colonies in America owed their origins to the trading corporation. It was the London Company, created by King\nJames I, in 1606, that laid during the following year the foundations of Virginia at Jamestown. It was under the auspices of their\nWest India Company, chartered in 1621, that the Dutch planted the settlements of the New Netherland in the valley of the Hudson.\nThe founders of Massachusetts were Puritan leaders and men of affairs whom King Charles I incorporated in 1629 under the title:\n\"The governor and company of the Massachusetts Bay in New England.\" In this case the law did but incorporate a group drawn\ntogether by religious ties. \"We must be knit together as one man,\" wrote John Winthrop, the first Puritan governor in America. Far\nto the south, on the banks of the Delaware River, a Swedish commercial company in 1638 made the beginnings of a settlement,\nchristened New Sweden; it was destined to pass under the rule of the Dutch, and finally under the rule of William Penn as the\nproprietary colony of Delaware.\n\nIn a certain sense, Georgia may be included among the \"company colonies.\" It was, however, originally conceived by the moving\nspirit, James Oglethorpe, as an asylum for poor men, especially those imprisoned for debt. To realize this humane purpose, he\nsecured from King George II, in 1732, a royal charter uniting several gentlemen, including himself, into \"one body politic and\ncorporate,\" known as the \"Trustees for establishing the colony of Georgia in America.\" In the structure of their organization and\ntheir methods of government, the trustees did not differ materially from the regular companies created for trade and colonization.\nThough their purposes were benevolent, their transactions had to be under the forms of law and according to the rules of business.\n\nThe Religious Congregation.—A second agency which figured largely in the settlement of America was the religious brotherhood, or\ncongregation, of men and women brought together in the bonds of a common religious faith. By one of the strange fortunes of\nhistory, this institution, founded in the early days of Christianity, proved to be a potent force in the origin and growth of\nself-government in a land far away from Galilee. \"And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul,\" we\nare told in the Acts describing the Church at Jerusalem. \"We are knit together as a body in a most sacred covenant of the Lord ...\nby virtue of which we hold ourselves strictly tied to all care of each other's good and of the whole,\" wrote John Robinson, a\nleader among the Pilgrims who founded their tiny colony of Plymouth in 1620. The Mayflower Compact, so famous in American history,\nwas but a written and signed agreement, incorporating the spirit of obedience to the common good, which served as a guide to\nself-government until Plymouth was annexed to Massachusetts in 1691.\n\nTHE ORIGINAL GRANTS [https://www.gutenberg.org/files/16960/16960-h/images/19-tb.jpg]\n[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/16960/16960-h/images/19.jpg]\n\nThree other colonies, all of which retained their identity until the eve of the American Revolution, likewise sprang directly from\nthe congregations of the faithful: Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New Hampshire, mainly offshoots from Massachusetts. They were\nfounded by small bodies of men and women, \"united in solemn covenants with the Lord,\" who planted their settlements in the\nwilderness. Not until many a year after Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson conducted their followers to the Narragansett country\nwas Rhode Island granted a charter of incorporation (1663) by the crown. Not until long after the congregation of Thomas Hooker\nfrom Newtown blazed the way into the Connecticut River Valley did the king of England give Connecticut a charter of its own (1662)\nand a place among the colonies. Half a century elapsed before the towns laid out beyond the Merrimac River by emigrants from\nMassachusetts were formed into the royal province of New Hampshire in 1679.\n\nEven when Connecticut was chartered, the parchment and sealing wax of the royal lawyers did but confirm rights and habits of\nself-government and obedience to law previously established by the congregations. The towns of Hartford, Windsor, and Wethersfield\nhad long lived happily under their \"Fundamental Orders\" drawn up by themselves in 1639; so had the settlers dwelt peacefully at\nNew Haven under their \"Fundamental Articles\" drafted in the same year. The pioneers on the Connecticut shore had no difficulty in\nagreeing that \"the Scriptures do hold forth a perfect rule for the direction and government of all men.\"\n\nThe Proprietor.—A third and very important colonial agency was the proprietor, or proprietary. As the name, associated with the\nword \"property,\" implies, the proprietor was a person to whom the king granted property in lands in North America to have, hold,\nuse, and enjoy for his own benefit and profit, with the right to hand the estate down to his heirs in perpetual succession.

  "contentHtml": "<h2>PART I. THE COLONIAL PERIOD</h2>\r\n<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>\r\n<h3>THE GREAT MIGRATION TO AMERICA</h3>\r\n<p>The tide of migration that set in toward the shores of North America during the early years of the seventeenth century was but one phase in the restless and eternal movement of mankind upon the surface of the earth. The ancient Greeks flung out their colonies in every direction, westward as far as Gaul, across the Mediterranean, and eastward into Asia Minor, perhaps to the very confines of India. The Romans, supported by their armies and their government, spread their dominion beyond the narrow lands of Italy until it stretched from the heather of Scotland to the sands of Arabia. The Teutonic tribes, from their home beyond the Danube and the Rhine, poured into the empire of the C&aelig;sars and made the beginnings of modern Europe. Of this great sweep of races and empires the settlement of America was merely a part. And it was, moreover, only one aspect of the expansion which finally carried the peoples, the institutions, and the trade of Europe to the very ends of the earth.</p>\r\n<p>In one vital point, it must be noted, American colonization differed from that of the ancients. The Greeks usually carried with them affection for the government they left behind and sacred fire from the altar of the parent city; but thousands of the immigrants who came to America disliked the state and&nbsp;<a></a>disowned the church of the mother country. They established compacts of government for themselves and set up altars of their own. They sought not only new soil to till but also political and religious liberty for themselves and their children.</p>\r\n<h3><span>The Agencies of American Colonization</span></h3>\r\n<p>It was no light matter for the English to cross three thousand miles of water and found homes in the American wilderness at the opening of the seventeenth century. Ships, tools, and supplies called for huge outlays of money. Stores had to be furnished in quantities sufficient to sustain the life of the settlers until they could gather harvests of their own. Artisans and laborers of skill and industry had to be induced to risk the hazards of the new world. Soldiers were required for defense and mariners for the exploration of inland waters. Leaders of good judgment, adept in managing men, had to be discovered. Altogether such an enterprise demanded capital larger than the ordinary merchant or gentleman could amass and involved risks more imminent than he dared to assume. Though in later days, after initial tests had been made, wealthy proprietors were able to establish colonies on their own account, it was the corporation that furnished the capital and leadership in the beginning.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Trading Company.</strong>&mdash;English pioneers in exploration found an instrument for colonization in companies of merchant adventurers, which had long been employed in carrying on commerce with foreign countries. Such a corporation was composed of many persons of different ranks of society&mdash;noblemen, merchants, and gentlemen&mdash;who banded together for a particular undertaking, each contributing a sum of money and sharing in the profits of the venture. It was organized under royal authority; it received its charter, its grant of land, and its trading privileges from the king and carried on its operations under his supervision and control. The charter named all the persons originally included in the corporation and gave them certain powers in the management&nbsp;<a></a>of its affairs, including the right to admit new members. The company was in fact a little government set up by the king. When the members of the corporation remained in England, as in the case of the Virginia Company, they operated through agents sent to the colony. When they came over the seas themselves and settled in America, as in the case of Massachusetts, they became the direct government of the country they possessed. The stockholders in that instance became the voters and the governor, the chief magistrate.</p>\r\n<div><a></a></div>\r\n<div><img title=\"John Winthrop, Governor of the Massachusetts Bay  Company\" src=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/16960/16960-h/images/17.jpg\" alt=\"John Winthrop, Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Company\">\r\n<div><span>John Winthrop, Governor of the<br>Massachusetts Bay Company</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Four of the thirteen colonies in America owed their origins to the trading corporation. It was the London Company, created by King James I, in 1606, that laid during the following year the foundations of Virginia at Jamestown. It was under the auspices of their West India Company, chartered in 1621, that the Dutch planted the settlements of the New Netherland in the valley of the Hudson. The founders of Massachusetts were Puritan leaders and men of affairs whom King Charles I incorporated in 1629 under the title: \"The governor and company of the Massachusetts Bay in New England.\" In this case the law did but incorporate a group drawn together by religious ties. \"We must be knit together as one man,\" wrote John Winthrop, the first Puritan governor in America. Far to the south, on the banks of the Delaware River, a Swedish commercial company in 1638 made the beginnings of a settlement, christened New Sweden; it was destined to pass under the rule of the Dutch, and finally under the rule of William Penn as the proprietary colony of Delaware.<a></a></p>\r\n<p>In a certain sense, Georgia may be included among the \"company colonies.\" It was, however, originally conceived by the moving spirit, James Oglethorpe, as an asylum for poor men, especially those imprisoned for debt. To realize this humane purpose, he secured from King George II, in 1732, a royal charter uniting several gentlemen, including himself, into \"one body politic and corporate,\" known as the \"Trustees for establishing the colony of Georgia in America.\" In the structure of their organization and their methods of government, the trustees did not differ materially from the regular companies created for trade and colonization. Though their purposes were benevolent, their transactions had to be under the forms of law and according to the rules of business.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Religious Congregation.</strong>&mdash;A second agency which figured largely in the settlement of America was the religious brotherhood, or congregation, of men and women brought together in the bonds of a common religious faith. By one of the strange fortunes of history, this institution, founded in the early days of Christianity, proved to be a potent force in the origin and growth of self-government in a land far away from Galilee. \"And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul,\" we are told in the Acts describing the Church at Jerusalem. \"We are knit together as a body in a most sacred covenant of the Lord ... by virtue of which we hold ourselves strictly tied to all care of each other's good and of the whole,\" wrote John Robinson, a leader among the Pilgrims who founded their tiny colony of Plymouth in 1620. The Mayflower Compact, so famous in American history, was but a written and signed agreement, incorporating the spirit of obedience to the common good, which served as a guide to self-government until Plymouth was annexed to Massachusetts in 1691.</p>\r\n<div><a></a><a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/16960/16960-h/images/19.jpg\"><img title=\"THE ORIGINAL GRANTS\" src=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/16960/16960-h/images/19-tb.jpg\" alt=\"THE ORIGINAL GRANTS\"></a></div>\r\n<p>Three other colonies, all of which retained their identity until the eve of the American Revolution, likewise sprang directly from the congregations of the faithful: Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New Hampshire, mainly offshoots from Massachu<a></a>setts. They were founded by small bodies of men and women, \"united in solemn covenants with the Lord,\" who planted their settlements in the wilderness. Not until many a year after Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson conducted their followers to the Narragansett country was Rhode Island granted a charter of incorporation (1663) by the crown. Not until long after the congregation of Thomas Hooker from Newtown blazed the way into the Connecticut River Valley did the king of England give Connecticut a charter of its own (1662) and a place among the colonies. Half a century elapsed before the towns laid out beyond the Merrimac River by emigrants from Massachusetts were formed into the royal province of New Hampshire in 1679.</p>\r\n<p>Even when Connecticut was chartered, the parchment and sealing wax of the royal lawyers did but confirm rights and habits of self-government and obedience to law previously established by the congregations. The towns of Hartford, Windsor, and Wethersfield had long lived happily under their \"Fundamental Orders\" drawn up by themselves in 1639; so had the settlers dwelt peacefully at New Haven under their \"Fundamental Articles\" drafted in the same year. The pioneers on the Connecticut shore had no difficulty in agreeing that \"the Scriptures do hold forth a perfect rule for the direction and government of all men.\"</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Proprietor.</strong>&mdash;A third and very important colonial agency was the proprietor, or proprietary. As the name, associated with the word \"property,\" implies, the proprietor was a person to whom the king granted property in lands in North America to have, hold, use, and enjoy for his own benefit and profit, with the right to hand the estate down to his heirs in perpetual succession. The proprietor was a rich and powerful person, prepared to furnish or secure the capital, collect the ships, supply the stores, and assemble the settlers necessary to found and sustain a plantation beyond the seas. Sometimes the proprietor worked alone. Sometimes two or more were associated like partners in the common undertaking.<a></a></p>\r\n<div><a></a></div>\r\n<div><img title=\"William Penn, Proprietor of Pennsylvania\" src=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/16960/16960-h/images/22.jpg\" alt=\"William Penn, Proprietor of Pennsylvania\">\r\n<div><span>William Penn,<br>Proprietor of Pennsylvania</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Five colonies, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and the Carolinas, owe their formal origins, though not always their first settlements, nor in most cases their prosperity, to the proprietary system.

  "contentText": "THE COW IN THE MIDDLE STATES.\n\nBY W. L. BATTLES, GIRARD, PA.\n\nInstead of writing on how a cow might be kept, I propose simply to tell just how we manage our cow, what we feed her, how we\nprocure that food; in fact everything relating to her care, so that any one can go and do likewise.\n\n“Spot,” we call her, for she has a beautiful white spot in her forehead, is not a Jersey, for we can not afford to buy one at the\nprices at which they are held with us; nor is she a thorough-bred of any kind; yet she is a good cow, of medium size, fills a\ntwelve-quart pail each night and morning, when her milk is in good flow, that raises a thick coat of rich cream, which, after been\nchurned, furnishes all the butter needed for a family of six, and some to spare. Our place is small, only two acres, and a portion\nof this is covered by the dwelling, barn, poultry-house, etc. The fruit garden occupies about one-fourth of an acre, and from this\nportion nothing is grown to furnish food for “Spot.” Adjoining the barn there is half an acre of the land in good grass, or mostly\nclover, and every spring a quart of clover seed is sown, so as fast as the old plants die out, young ones take their places. A\nbushel of land plaster is sown on this when the grass begins to start in the spring. This plot produces a very heavy growth of\ngrass and clover, enabling us to cut it three times each season; about the first of June, August, and of October. A coat of fine\nmanure is always spread over the ground immediately after each mowing. The grass is mostly cured, and makes fine hay for winter\nfeeding. Occasionally a small portion of the crop is used green for soiling. Besides the land occupied by buildings, fruit garden,\nand clover plot, there remains about one acre, which we call the garden. Here are grown all the vegetables for the family’s use,\nbesides some to sell. About one-fourth of it is planted to Early Rose potatoes, and as soon as these are sufficiently ripe for use\nor market, they are dug, and sweet corn, in drills, for fodder, is sown upon the land. Another fourth of an acre is planted to\nsugar beets; the ground being very rich, the yield is always large; this last season (1879), though very dry, I harvested one\nhundred and seventy-eight bushels. Our cow is very fond of the beets, and I think there is nothing better to keep up a flow of\nmilk, and they give it no bad flavor, as do turnips. An additional fourth of an acre is planted to sweet, or evergreen,[17] corn;\nas fast as the corn is picked for use or market, the green stalks are cut up, run through the cutting-box, and every particle of\nthem consumed. As soon as the corn is all harvested, the ground it occupied is thoroughly fitted and manured, and then sown to\nwinter rye, to be used for soiling the next spring, after which the ground is again prepared for corn. The remaining fourth acre\nis devoted to early peas, beans, cabbages and other garden vegetables. As soon as one crop is off, the ground is prepared, and\nsomething else is almost always planted or sown; consequently, on the most of this acre, two crops are produced each season,\nexcept where sugar-beets are grown, or late cabbages, which require the whole season to mature. With the clover on the half acre,\nand the forage crop and roots on the acre, we have not only had sufficient food for the cow the entire season, but have also kept\nour family horse, with the exception of one load of oat-straw purchased for three dollars, to mix in with the fodder corn; this is\nhard to cure sufficiently to keep bright and sweet through the winter, but by mixing a layer of corn-fodder, and a layer of straw,\nit all comes out nice and bright. Besides keeping both horse and cow, we have marketed from this little farm, in berries,\nvegetables, butter, eggs, poultry, and one fat hog, weighing, dressed, over three hundred pounds, four hundred and sixty-eight\ndollars’ worth of the above produce, keeping enough for our own use, and salting down one barrel of pork.\n\n\nTHE BARN.\n\nThe barn is twenty-five by thirty feet, with the stable on the south side. The stall for “Spot” is five feet wide, and the floor\non which she stands is five feet long, with a manger two feet wide in front, one and a half high next to the cow, and three feet\nnext to the barn floor. She is fastened with a wide strap around her neck, attached to a chain eighteen inches long, which is\nfastened to a staple driven into a post at the corner of the stall adjoining the manger; this gives her room to turn her head so\nas to lick any portion of her body. The floor is made of two-inch plank, battened on the under side with thin boards, raised from\nthe ground ten inches in rear and one foot in front; all the droppings and urine fall into the four-foot alley behind. This alley\nhas a clay floor beaten perfectly solid and level. Next to the stable door is a large bin, ten by seven feet, for storing\nroad-dust or muck; at the other end of the stable is another bin, ten by eleven feet, for storing leaves for bedding.[18] My great\nobject is not only to make “Spot” comfortable, and have her stable free from all bad odors, but to save all the manure, both\nliquid and solid. The best absorbent is dried muck, pulverized, or road-dust from clayey roads. As it is easier to procure the\nlatter, I generally make use of that, and always keep from two to three inches of it in the alley; this effectually absorbs all\nthe liquid portions and all offensive odors. Twice each day, this is thrown out through a window closed by a sliding shutter in\nthe rear of the stall, under a shed, where it remains until wanted for use. In the fall, I go to the woods and procure a\nsufficient quantity of leaves to last until spring; a liberal use of these not only makes a nice, soft, clean bed, but largely\nincreases the quantity of manure. The stable opens into a small yard, across one corner of which runs a small brook. Each morning,\nthe cow is permitted to go out and drink; if the weather is pleasant, she is allowed to remain out an hour for exercise. She is\nlet out the same at night, after sunset in warm weather, so that she will not be annoyed by flies. The barn is well-battened, and\nis warm in winter; it is well ventilated by two windows, but these, in summer, are darkened by blinds, with wide slats, to keep\nout flies.\n\n\nSYSTEM OF FEEDING.\n\nEach morning, while “Spot” is eating her breakfast, she is well curried with a curry comb or card, and if any filth is observed on\nher bag or teats (which is very seldom), they are carefully washed off, if in winter, with warm water. She is never scolded nor\nwhipped; consequently she never kicks over the pail, or holds up her milk. She is fed in winter with a peck of sugar-beets cut up,\nboth morning, noon, and night; also, a bushel of cut feed, either corn-stalks or clover hay, wet with a pailful of hot water, with\ntwo quarts of “sugar meal,” or bran, thoroughly mixed together, with a little salt sprinkled over it. I generally use what is\nknown here as “sugar meal” to mix with her feed; it is corn meal from the factory after the sugar or glucose has been extracted;\nit costs from ten cents to twelve and a half cents per bushel, and I prefer it to bran, and “Spot” likes it very much. We consider\nher a machine for converting the food we give her into milk, and the more we can get her to eat and digest, the more milk is\nobtained, and the greater the profit. It is a good plan to change the food occasionally, substituting carrots for beets, clover\nhay for corn fodder, for brutes, like mankind, are fond of a variety. There are root-cutters that can be procured for\ncutting[19] up roots, but I have always used a common spade, ground sharp, and an empty flour barrel to hold the beets. It takes\nbut a few minutes to cut up a mess of beets in that way.\n\n\nMANURE.\n\nWith a bin of road-dust, and one of leaves, a winter’s supply of litter is secured, and it is surprising what a pile of manure we\nhave in the spring. Another valuable source of manure is the pigsty, with plenty of leaves for a warm bed, and sufficient\nroad-dust to absorb all the liquids, it is astonishing how clean our pigs are, and the sty is free from all bad odors; the big\npotatoes and mammoth beets, show the richness of the pig-pen fertilizer. I think our fifty hens pay for all their food with the\ndroppings the poultry-house furnishes. The roosts are over a slanting platform, which is kept covered with road-dust both summer\nand winter; the droppings fall on this floor, and roll down into a large box twelve feet long, three feet wide, and three feet\ndeep. The dust the chickens work down with the droppings is sufficient to absorb all the ammonia and preserve all the fertilizing\nqualities of this most valuable guano. A large box of road-dust is always kept in the water-closet, a liberal use of which\nfurnishes a quantity of most valuable fertilizer, besides freeing the closets from all noxious smells. The wash water and slops\nfrom the kitchen are utilized by being thrown on a pile of sods and other rubbish, which are forked over, and as soon as decayed,\ncarted to the manure pile. From so many sources we are enabled to give our small farm a most liberal supply of manure each spring\nand fall, so that even with the double cropping most of it gets, it continues to improve, and yields more bountifully each\nsucceeding season.\n\n\nCROPS AND TILLAGE.\n\nIn the cultivation of sugar beets, the ground is first manured heavily, plowed deep, and thoroughly pulverized with the\ncultivator, then marked out in rows with a garden plow, two feet apart. Manure from the poultry-house is scattered in each furrow,\nwhich should be lightly covered with soil, so the seed will not come in contact with it; drop the seeds about six inches apart,\ncovering lightly with the garden rake. When the leaves are about four inches long, thin out to one plant in a place, and fill any\nvacancies with the plants pulled out. Hoe them thoroughly, destroying all weeds, which can easily be done by cultivating each time\nbefore hoeing, with an arrow cultivator. Keep the ground[20] mellow, and cultivate three or four times, after which they will take\ncare of themselves and soon cover the ground. With ground in good condition, and a fair season, six hundred to eight hundred\nbushels per acre can be easily produced. Let them grow until frost comes, when they should be dug with a garden fork, the tops cut\noff, and stored for winter. Those to be used before the first of March, are stored in the cellar, the others are buried in a long\npit, digging out a shallow place, piling up the roots about three feet high, and three feet wide, covering well with straw and\nsufficient soil to keep them from freezing, putting in a drain-tile about every four feet in the top of the pile, with one end to\nproject a little through the covering, for ventilation. If the weather becomes very cold, lay a turf over the tile, and remove\nwhen pleasant. I grow carrots after the same plan, and store in like manner. I prefer beets, as they are so much larger, it is\nless trouble to gather and take care of them, and the crop is generally larger, still I always grow some carrots for a change. I\nplant sweet corn in drills, always put some fertilizer along the furrow, dropping the kernels about eight inches apart, with the\nrows three feet wide, I commence planting soon after May first, and continue at intervals until about July first, so I can have a\nfresh supply for use, and market, all the season. The sweet corn being grown on the plot sown to winter rye, for soiling, enables\nus to cut some portions of it twice, before the ground is needed for corn. When sowing corn for fodder, which is done as soon as\nwe commence digging the early potatoes, I sow it in drills two feet apart, and drop the kernels about one inch apart in the\ndrills, manure from the pigsty is first dropped in the furrow, and covered with soil at least two inches deep, or the corn will\nnot come up. This fertilizer is so strong, if properly used it causes a most extraordinary growth of stalks. While the corn is\nsmall, cultivate it two or three times with a narrow cultivator, when it will take care of itself, and there will be a surprising\ngrowth of stalks; I have them often six feet high. Just before time for frosts, cut with a scythe, and set up in small bunches\nbound around the top, and leave to cure until cold weather. When it is to be put in the mow, spread alternately a layer of stalks,\nand a layer of straw, and it will keep bright and sweet until wanted. The rye for spring soiling is sown when the sweet corn is\npicked, and stalks removed, in drills about ten inches apart. Fine manure is spread on the ground after plowing, and thoroughly\nmixed with the surface soil; one or two hoeings being given to keep the ground mellow; to destroy any weeds that may make their\nappearance. By May[21] first, the early sown rye will cover the ground with a dense growth, at least four feet high, furnishing a\nlarge quantity of most nutritious green food. On those portions of the plot where the latest corn is to be planted, two or three\ncuttings are made; this gives most excellent food for the cow, and the quantity grown on this fourth of an acre will surprise any\none who has never tried it. There is quite a plot of early peas, and as soon as the last picking occurs, while the vines are\ngreen, they are pulled and fed to “Spot,” who relishes them very much. Turnips, or corn, are at once sown on the ground where the\npeas were.\n\nWhen our early cabbages are taken up, all the leaves, and much of the stalks, are turned into milk by taking them to the cow’s\nmanger, and the ground at once planted, or sown, to something that will make more food. The beet, carrot, and turnip tops, and\nlate cabbage leaves, make quite a quantity of feed late in the fall, if care is taken in saving and preserving them. Possibly\nthere may be some better forage crop than “evergreen,” or sugar corn; I think another fall I will try the Minnesota Amber Sugar\nCane, in a small way. I tried Pearl Millet, in one row, this season; it tillered, or spread wonderfully, but did not do so well as\nthe corn, as the stalks were small, and the millet makes such a feeble growth, at first, it requires the whole season to produce\nas much fodder as I get from corn sowed the fourth of July.\n\n\nCALVING.\n\nI generally manage to have the cow come in about the first of September; by that means the six weeks time she is allowed to go\ndry, occurs during the warmest portion of the summer, viz., in July and August, when, with the facilities the person who keeps but\none cow possesses, it is difficult to make good butter. This is also the season when butter most generally sells the lowest.\n\nThe calf is taught to drink after it is a week or ten days old, and fed on a porridge made from skim-milk and wheat middlings, or\nshorts; by the time it is six weeks or two months old it will be well fattened, and can be sold to the butcher for veal, at a good\nprice, for at that season of the year veal is scarce and in demand. The cow being in full flow of milk all winter, when butter is\nmost always high, will pay a good profit for her feed and care. A couple of weeks prior to the time the calf should be born, I\nmake a box stall on the barn floor, and permit the cow to run loose in it until the calf is taken away to learn to drink. During\nthis time she should have a good bed of leaves, and the stall be cleaned each night and morning. So far at such times I have\nexperienced[22] no difficulty, or trouble; should any occur, it is better to apply to an experienced person, than to try and\n“doctor” her yourself. After the calf is born, I feed the cow on warm slops a day or two, permitting the calf to suck until the\nswelling has gone from her bag, and it has assumed its natural condition. Then, as before stated, teach it to drink, which can\neasily be done by inserting the finger in its mouth, and putting its head in the dish, cautiously withdrawing the finger a few\ntimes, and in a short time you will have no difficulty, as it will help itself.\n\nIn conclusion, I can say I have tried to state just how our cow is managed and kept. I presume there can be improvements made on\nour system. I shall be glad to take advantage of the experience of others, at any and all times. No record is kept of the milk\nobtained, or of the butter made. We know we always have plenty for the family’s use, and considerable to spare. Bread and milk\nfurnish the children half their food a portion of the time. Pure milk and plenty of fresh fruits, in abundance, we consider afford\none of the principal reasons why our family is so healthy, and we have so few doctor’s bills to pay.\n\nFrom our acre and a half, all the food has been grown for both cow and horse, except the three dollars expended for straw. The\n“sugar meal” given the cow has not cost five dollars during the past year. It is safe to say, that one half, and probably more, of\nthe clover, corn fodder, green rye, etc., has been fed to the horse. Consequently the keeping of the cow can all be credited to\nthe small area of about three-fourths of an acre of land, in addition to an outlay of not exceeding seven dollars for meal, bran,\nand straw. This land, about one half of it, has also produced, in addition, full crops for the use of the family, or market, while\nthe sour milk and buttermilk have largely assisted in making six hundred pounds of pork. The calf, at less than two months of age,\nwas sold for eight dollars, which more than paid for the extra feed bought for the cow. The family which has never kept a cow can\nhardly realize the satisfaction and benefits derived from such a source. Children, whose appetites are often capricious, will\nalmost always relish a cup of cool milk. Cream, for our coffee at breakfast, is much enjoyed by all, but realized by few, and what\ncan be more delicious than a nice dish of strawberries smothered in rich yellow cream. When we consider the small expense, the\nlittle trouble and care, contrasted with the great benefits derived, it is, so to speak, surprising that any family should rest\nsatisfied without possessing a cow.\n\n[23]\n\n[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/68093/68093-h/images/figure2.jpg]\n\nFig. 2.—the ayrshire cow “old creamer.”",

BATTLES, GIRARD, PA.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Instead of writing on how a cow might be kept, I propose simply to tell just how we manage our cow, what we feed her, how we procure that food; in fact everything relating to her care, so that any one can go and do likewise.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Spot,&rdquo; we call her, for she has a beautiful white spot in her forehead, is not a Jersey, for we can not afford to buy one at the prices at which they are held with us; nor is she a thorough-bred of any kind; yet she is a good cow, of medium size, fills a twelve-quart pail each night and morning, when her milk is in good flow, that raises a thick coat of rich cream, which, after been churned, furnishes all the butter needed for a family of six, and some to spare. Our place is small, only two acres, and a portion of this is covered by the dwelling, barn, poultry-house, etc. The fruit garden occupies about one-fourth of an acre, and from this portion nothing is grown to furnish food for &ldquo;Spot.&rdquo; Adjoining the barn there is half an acre of the land in good grass, or mostly clover, and every spring a quart of clover seed is sown, so as fast as the old plants die out, young ones take their places. A bushel of land plaster is sown on this when the grass begins to start in the spring. This plot produces a very heavy growth of grass and clover, enabling us to cut it three times each season; about the first of June, August, and of October. A coat of fine manure is always spread over the ground immediately after each mowing. The grass is mostly cured, and makes fine hay for winter feeding. Occasionally a small portion of the crop is used green for soiling. Besides the land occupied by buildings, fruit garden, and clover plot, there remains about one acre, which we call the garden. Here are grown all the vegetables for the family&rsquo;s use, besides some to sell. About one-fourth of it is planted to Early Rose potatoes, and as soon as these are sufficiently ripe for use or market, they are dug, and sweet corn, in drills, for fodder, is sown upon the land. Another fourth of an acre is planted to sugar beets; the ground being very rich, the yield is always large; this last season (1879), though very dry, I harvested one hundred and seventy-eight bushels. Our cow is very fond of the beets, and I think there is nothing better to keep up a flow of milk, and they give it no bad flavor, as do turnips. An additional fourth of an acre is planted to sweet, or evergreen,<span><a></a>[17]</span>&nbsp;corn; as fast as the corn is picked for use or market, the green stalks are cut up, run through the cutting-box, and every particle of them consumed. As soon as the corn is all harvested, the ground it occupied is thoroughly fitted and manured, and then sown to winter rye, to be used for soiling the next spring, after which the ground is again prepared for corn. The remaining fourth acre is devoted to early peas, beans, cabbages and other garden vegetables. As soon as one crop is off, the ground is prepared, and something else is almost always planted or sown; consequently, on the most of this acre, two crops are produced each season, except where sugar-beets are grown, or late cabbages, which require the whole season to mature. With the clover on the half acre, and the forage crop and roots on the acre, we have not only had sufficient food for the cow the entire season, but have also kept our family horse, with the exception of one load of oat-straw purchased for three dollars, to mix in with the fodder corn; this is hard to cure sufficiently to keep bright and sweet through the winter, but by mixing a layer of corn-fodder, and a layer of straw, it all comes out nice and bright. Besides keeping both horse and cow, we have marketed from this little farm, in berries, vegetables, butter, eggs, poultry, and one fat hog, weighing, dressed, over three hundred pounds, four hundred and sixty-eight dollars&rsquo; worth of the above produce, keeping enough for our own use, and salting down one barrel of pork.</p>\r\n<h3>THE BARN.</h3>\r\n<p>The barn is twenty-five by thirty feet, with the stable on the south side. The stall for &ldquo;Spot&rdquo; is five feet wide, and the floor on which she stands is five feet long, with a manger two feet wide in front, one and a half high next to the cow, and three feet next to the barn floor. She is fastened with a wide strap around her neck, attached to a chain eighteen inches long, which is fastened to a staple driven into a post at the corner of the stall adjoining the manger; this gives her room to turn her head so as to lick any portion of her body. The floor is made of two-inch plank, battened on the under side with thin boards, raised from the ground ten inches in rear and one foot in front; all the droppings and urine fall into the four-foot alley behind. This alley has a clay floor beaten perfectly solid and level. Next to the stable door is a large bin, ten by seven feet, for storing road-dust or muck; at the other end of the stable is another bin, ten by eleven feet, for storing leaves for bedding.<span><a></a>[18]</span>&nbsp;My great object is not only to make &ldquo;Spot&rdquo; comfortable, and have her stable free from all bad odors, but to save all the manure, both liquid and solid. The best absorbent is dried muck, pulverized, or road-dust from clayey roads. As it is easier to procure the latter, I generally make use of that, and always keep from two to three inches of it in the alley; this effectually absorbs all the liquid portions and all offensive odors. Twice each day, this is thrown out through a window closed by a sliding shutter in the rear of the stall, under a shed, where it remains until wanted for use. In the fall, I go to the woods and procure a sufficient quantity of leaves to last until spring; a liberal use of these not only makes a nice, soft, clean bed, but largely increases the quantity of manure. The stable opens into a small yard, across one corner of which runs a small brook. Each morning, the cow is permitted to go out and drink; if the weather is pleasant, she is allowed to remain out an hour for exercise. She is let out the same at night, after sunset in warm weather, so that she will not be annoyed by flies. The barn is well-battened, and is warm in winter; it is well ventilated by two windows, but these, in summer, are darkened by blinds, with wide slats, to keep out flies.</p>\r\n<h3>SYSTEM OF FEEDING.</h3>\r\n<p>Each morning, while &ldquo;Spot&rdquo; is eating her breakfast, she is well curried with a curry comb or card, and if any filth is observed on her bag or teats (which is very seldom), they are carefully washed off, if in winter, with warm water. She is never scolded nor whipped; consequently she never kicks over the pail, or holds up her milk. She is fed in winter with a peck of sugar-beets cut up, both morning, noon, and night; also, a bushel of cut feed, either corn-stalks or clover hay, wet with a pailful of hot water, with two quarts of &ldquo;sugar meal,&rdquo; or bran, thoroughly mixed together, with a little salt sprinkled over it. I generally use what is known here as &ldquo;sugar meal&rdquo; to mix with her feed; it is corn meal from the factory after the sugar or glucose has been extracted; it costs from ten cents to twelve and a half cents per bushel, and I prefer it to bran, and &ldquo;Spot&rdquo; likes it very much. We consider her a machine for converting the food we give her into milk, and the more we can get her to eat and digest, the more milk is obtained, and the greater the profit. It is a good plan to change the food occasionally, substituting carrots for beets, clover hay for corn fodder, for brutes, like mankind, are fond of a variety. There are root-cutters that can be procured for cutting<span><a></a>[19]</span>&nbsp;up roots, but I have always used a common spade, ground sharp, and an empty flour barrel to hold the beets. It takes but a few minutes to cut up a mess of beets in that way.</p>\r\n<h3>MANURE.</h3>\r\n<p>With a bin of road-dust, and one of leaves, a winter&rsquo;s supply of litter is secured, and it is surprising what a pile of manure we have in the spring. Another valuable source of manure is the pigsty, with plenty of leaves for a warm bed, and sufficient road-dust to absorb all the liquids, it is astonishing how clean our pigs are, and the sty is free from all bad odors; the big potatoes and mammoth beets, show the richness of the pig-pen fertilizer. I think our fifty hens pay for all their food with the droppings the poultry-house furnishes. The roosts are over a slanting platform, which is kept covered with road-dust both summer and winter; the droppings fall on this floor, and roll down into a large box twelve feet long, three feet wide, and three feet deep. The dust the chickens work down with the droppings is sufficient to absorb all the ammonia and preserve all the fertilizing qualities of this most valuable guano. A large box of road-dust is always kept in the water-closet, a liberal use of which furnishes a quantity of most valuable fertilizer, besides freeing the closets from all noxious smells. The wash water and slops from the kitchen are utilized by being thrown on a pile of sods and other rubbish, which are forked over, and as soon as decayed, carted to the manure pile. From so many sources we are enabled to give our small farm a most liberal supply of manure each spring and fall, so that even with the double cropping most of it gets, it continues to improve, and yields more bountifully each succeeding season.</p>\r\n<h3>CROPS AND TILLAGE.</h3>\r\n<p>In the cultivation of sugar beets, the ground is first manured heavily, plowed deep, and thoroughly pulverized with the cultivator, then marked out in rows with a garden plow, two feet apart. Manure from the poultry-house is scattered in each furrow, which should be lightly covered with soil, so the seed will not come in contact with it; drop the seeds about six inches apart, covering lightly with the garden rake. When the leaves are about four inches long, thin out to one plant in a place, and fill any vacancies with the plants pulled out. Hoe them thoroughly, destroying all weeds, which can easily be done by cultivating each time before hoeing, with an arrow cultivator. Keep the ground<span><a></a>[20]</span>&nbsp;mellow, and cultivate three or four times, after which they will take care of themselves and soon cover the ground. With ground in good condition, and a fair season, six hundred to eight hundred bushels per acre can be easily produced. Let them grow until frost comes, when they should be dug with a garden fork, the tops cut off, and stored for winter. Those to be used before the first of March, are stored in the cellar, the others are buried in a long pit, digging out a shallow place, piling up the roots about three feet high, and three feet wide, covering well with straw and sufficient soil to keep them from freezing, putting in a drain-tile about every four feet in the top of the pile, with one end to project a little through the covering, for ventilation. If the weather becomes very cold, lay a turf over the tile, and remove when pleasant. I grow carrots after the same plan, and store in like manner. I prefer beets, as they are so much larger, it is less trouble to gather and take care of them, and the crop is generally larger, still I always grow some carrots for a change. I plant sweet corn in drills, always put some fertilizer along the furrow, dropping the kernels about eight inches apart, with the rows three feet wide, I commence planting soon after May first, and continue at intervals until about July first, so I can have a fresh supply for use, and market, all the season. The sweet corn being grown on the plot sown to winter rye, for soiling, enables us to cut some portions of it twice, before the ground is needed for corn. When sowing corn for fodder, which is done as soon as we commence digging the early potatoes, I sow it in drills two feet apart, and drop the kernels about one inch apart in the drills, manure from the pigsty is first dropped in the furrow, and covered with soil at least two inches deep, or the corn will not come up. This fertilizer is so strong, if properly used it causes a most extraordinary growth of stalks. While the corn is small, cultivate it two or three times with a narrow cultivator, when it will take care of itself, and there will be a surprising growth of stalks; I have them often six feet high. Just before time for frosts, cut with a scythe, and set up in small bunches bound around the top, and leave to cure until cold weather. When it is to be put in the mow, spread alternately a layer of stalks, and a layer of straw, and it will keep bright and sweet until wanted. The rye for spring soiling is sown when the sweet corn is picked, and stalks removed, in drills about ten inches apart. Fine manure is spread on the ground after plowing, and thoroughly mixed with the surface soil; one or two hoeings being given to keep the ground mellow; to destroy any weeds that may make their appearance. By May<span><a></a>[21]</span>&nbsp;first, the early sown rye will cover the ground with a dense growth, at least four feet high, furnishing a large quantity of most nutritious green food. On those portions of the plot where the latest corn is to be planted, two or three cuttings are made; this gives most excellent food for the cow, and the quantity grown on this fourth of an acre will surprise any one who has never tried it. There is quite a plot of early peas, and as soon as the last picking occurs, while the vines are green, they are pulled and fed to &ldquo;Spot,&rdquo; who relishes them very much. Turnips, or corn, are at once sown on the ground where the peas were.</p>\r\n<p>When our early cabbages are taken up, all the leaves, and much of the stalks, are turned into milk by taking them to the cow&rsquo;s manger, and the ground at once planted, or sown, to something that will make more food. The beet, carrot, and turnip tops, and late cabbage leaves, make quite a quantity of feed late in the fall, if care is taken in saving and preserving them. Possibly there may be some better forage crop than &ldquo;evergreen,&rdquo; or sugar corn; I think another fall I will try the Minnesota Amber Sugar Cane, in a small way. I tried Pearl Millet, in one row, this season; it tillered, or spread wonderfully, but did not do so well as the corn, as the stalks were small, and the millet makes such a feeble growth, at first, it requires the whole season to produce as much fodder as I get from corn sowed the fourth of July.</p>\r\n<h3>CALVING.</h3>\r\n<p>I generally manage to have the cow come in about the first of September; by that means the six weeks time she is allowed to go dry, occurs during the warmest portion of the summer, viz., in July and August, when, with the facilities the person who keeps but one cow possesses, it is difficult to make good butter. This is also the season when butter most generally sells the lowest.</p>\r\n<p>The calf is taught to drink after it is a week or ten days old, and fed on a porridge made from skim-milk and wheat middlings, or shorts; by the time it is six weeks or two months old it will be well fattened, and can be sold to the butcher for veal, at a good price, for at that season of the year veal is scarce and in demand. The cow being in full flow of milk all winter, when butter is most always high, will pay a good profit for her feed and care. A couple of weeks prior to the time the calf should be born, I make a box stall on the barn floor, and permit the cow to run loose in it until the calf is taken away to learn to drink. During this time she should have a good bed of leaves, and the stall be cleaned each night and morning. So far at such times I have experienced<span><a></a>[22]</span>&nbsp;no difficulty, or trouble; should any occur, it is better to apply to an experienced person, than to try and &ldquo;doctor&rdquo; her yourself. After the calf is born, I feed the cow on warm slops a day or two, permitting the calf to suck until the swelling has gone from her bag, and it has assumed its natural condition. Then, as before stated, teach it to drink, which can easily be done by inserting the finger in its mouth, and putting its head in the dish, cautiously withdrawing the finger a few times, and in a short time you will have no difficulty, as it will help itself.</p>\r\n<p>In conclusion, I can say I have tried to state just how our cow is managed and kept. I presume there can be improvements made on our system. I shall be glad to take advantage of the experience of others, at any and all times. No record is kept of the milk obtained, or of the butter made. We know we always have plenty for the family&rsquo;s use, and considerable to spare. Bread and milk furnish the children half their food a portion of the time. Pure milk and plenty of fresh fruits, in abundance, we consider afford one of the principal reasons why our family is so healthy, and we have so few doctor&rsquo;s bills to pay.</p>\r\n<p>From our acre and a half, all the food has been grown for both cow and horse, except the three dollars expended for straw. The &ldquo;sugar meal&rdquo; given the cow has not cost five dollars during the past year. It is safe to say, that one half, and probably more, of the clover, corn fodder, green rye, etc., has been fed to the horse. Consequently the keeping of the cow can all be credited to the small area of about three-fourths of an acre of land, in addition to an outlay of not exceeding seven dollars for meal, bran, and straw. This land, about one half of it, has also produced, in addition, full crops for the use of the family, or market, while the sour milk and buttermilk have largely assisted in making six hundred pounds of pork. The calf, at less than two months of age, was sold for eight dollars, which more than paid for the extra feed bought for the cow. The family which has never kept a cow can hardly realize the satisfaction and benefits derived from such a source. Children, whose appetites are often capricious, will almost always relish a cup of cool milk. Cream, for our coffee at breakfast, is much enjoyed by all, but realized by few, and what can be more delicious than a nice dish of strawberries smothered in rich yellow cream. When we consider the small expense, the little trouble and care, contrasted with the great benefits derived, it is, so to speak, surprising that any family should rest satisfied without possessing a cow.</p>\r\n<p><span><a></a>[23]</span></p>\r\n<div><img src=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/68093/68093-h/images/figure2.jpg\" alt width=\"700\" height=\"450\">\r\n<p>Fig. 2.&mdash;<span>the ayrshire cow &ldquo;old creamer.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n</div>",

The\nsupporters of the first theory quote in its favor the fact that the pagan symbols and images of gods appear on coins struck by\nConstantine and his sons; but this fact is easily explained, when we consider that the coinage of bronze was a privilege of the\nSenate, and that the Senate was pagan by a large majority. Many of Constantine's constitutions and official letters speak in favor\nof an early declaration of faith. When the Donatists appealed to him from the verdict of the councils of Arles and Rome, he wrote\nto the bishops: Meum judicium postulant, qui ipse judicium Christi expecto: \"They appeal to me, when I myself must be judged by\nChrist.\" The verdict of the council of Rome against the sectarians was rendered on October 2, 313, in the \"palace of Fausta in the\nLateran;\" the imperial palace of the Lateran, therefore, had already been handed over to the bishop of Rome, and a portion of it\nturned into a place of worship. The22 basilica of the Lateran still retains its title of \"Mother and head of all churches of Rome,\nand of the world,\" ranking above those of S. Peter and S. Paul in respect to age.\n\nSuch being the state of affairs when the triumphal arch was erected, nothing prevents us from believing those two words to be\noriginal, and to express the relations then existing between the first Christian emperor and the old pagan Senate. At all events,\nnothing is more uncompromising than these two words, because the titles of Deus summus, Deus altissimus, magnus, æternus, are\nconstantly found on monuments pertaining to the worship of Atys and Mithras. \"These words,\" concludes de Rossi, \"far from being a\nprofession of Christianity engraved on the arch at a later period, are simply a 'moyen terme,' a compromise, between the feelings\nof the Senate and those of the emperor.\"[15] [https://www.gutenberg.org/files/22153/22153-h/22153-h.htm#Footnote_15_15]\n\nMany facts related by contemporary documents prove that the change of religion was, at the beginning, a personal affair with the\nemperor, and not a question of state; the emperor was a Christian, but the old rules of the empire were not interfered with. In\ndealing with his pagan subjects Constantine showed so much tact and impartiality as to cast doubts upon the sincerity of his\nconversion. He has been accused of having accepted from the people of Hispellum (Spello, in Umbria), the honor of a temple, and\nfrom the inhabitants of Roman Africa that of a priesthood for the worship of his own family (sacerdotium Flaviæ gentis). The\nexculpation is given by Constantine himself in his address of thanks to the Hispellates: \"We are pleased and grateful for your\ndetermination to raise a temple in honor of our family and of ourselves; and we accept23 it, provided you do not contaminate it\nwith superstitious practices.\" The honor of a temple and of a priesthood, therefore, was offered and accepted as a political\ndemonstration, as an act of loyalty, and as an occasion for public festivities, both inaugural and anniversary.\n\nPicture of Orpheus found in the Catacombs of Priscilla.

First, as to symbolic images allowed in churches and cemeteries. Of Orpheus playing on the\nlyre, while watching his flock, as a substitute for the Good Shepherd, there have been found in the catacombs four paintings, two\nreliefs on sarcophagi, one engraving on a gem.

[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/22153/22153-h/images/024.png]\nThe Four Seasons, from the Imperial Palace, Ostia.\n\n24The belief that the sibyls had prophesied the advent of Christ made their images popular. The church of the Aracœli is\nparticularly associated with them, because tradition refers the origin of its name to an altar—ARA PRIMOGENITI DEI—raised to the\nson of God by the emperor Augustus, who had been warned of his advent by the sibylline books. For this reason the figures of\nAugustus and of the Tiburtine sibyl are painted on either side of the arch above the high altar. They have actually been given the\nplace of honor in this church; and formerly, when at Christmas time the Presepio was exhibited in the second chapel on the left,\nthey occupied the front row, the sibyl pointing out to Augustus the Virgin and the Bambino who appeared in the sky in a halo of\nlight. The two figures, carved in wood, have now disappeared; they were given away or sold thirty years ago, when a new set\nof25 images was offered to the Presepio by prince Alexander Torlonia. Prophets and sibyls appear also in Renaissance monuments;\nthey were modelled by della Porta in the Santa Casa at Loretto, painted by Michelangelo in the Sistine chapel, by Raphael in S.\nMaria della Pace, by Pinturicchio in the Borgia apartments, engraved by Baccio Baldini, a contemporary of Sandro Botticelli, and\n\"graffite\" by Matteo di Giovanni in the pavement of the Duomo at Siena.",

Here is the latest representation discovered, from the Catacombs of Priscilla (1888).</p>\r\n<div><a></a><img title src=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/22153/22153-h/images/024.png\" alt=\"The Four Seasons, from the Imperial Palace, Ostia.\" width=\"515\" height=\"428\"><br><span>The Four Seasons, from the Imperial Palace, Ostia.</span></div>\r\n<p><span><a></a>24</span>The belief that the sibyls had prophesied the advent of Christ made their images popular. The church of the Arac&oelig;li is particularly associated with them, because tradition refers the origin of its name to an altar&mdash;ARA PRIMOGENITI DEI&mdash;raised to the son of God by the emperor Augustus, who had been warned of his advent by the sibylline books. For this reason the figures of Augustus and of the Tiburtine sibyl are painted on either side of the arch above the high altar. They have actually been given the place of honor in this church; and formerly, when at Christmas time the&nbsp;<em>Presepio</em>&nbsp;was exhibited in the second chapel on the left, they occupied the front row, the sibyl pointing out to Augustus the Virgin and the Bambino who appeared in the sky in a halo of light. The two figures, carved in wood, have now disappeared; they were given away or sold thirty years ago, when a new set of<span><a></a>25</span>&nbsp;images was offered to the&nbsp;<em>Presepio</em>&nbsp;by prince Alexander Torlonia. Prophets and sibyls appear also in Renaissance monuments; they were modelled by della Porta in the Santa Casa at Loretto, painted by Michelangelo in the Sistine chapel, by Raphael in S. Maria della Pace, by Pinturicchio in the Borgia apartments, engraved by Baccio Baldini, a contemporary of Sandro Botticelli, and \"graffite\" by Matteo di Giovanni in the pavement of the Duomo at Siena.</p>",
